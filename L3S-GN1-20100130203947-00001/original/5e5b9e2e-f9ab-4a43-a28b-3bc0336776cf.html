That was a smaller drop than expected, and investors &#151; apparently unfazed by news of the raid &#151; sent the company&#145;s stock as much as 3 percent higher. <p>Yonhap news agency, quoting sources involved in the raid, reported that dozens of prosecutors and investigators seized documents and other materials related to the allegations in Tuesday&#145;s raid. <p>The probe, which started last week, came after Kim Yong-chul, a former top legal affairs official at Samsung, alleged that the conglomerate set up a $215 million slush fund to bribe influential figures such as prosecutors, judges and government officials. <p>Samsung, a conglomerate spanning dozens of companies with interests ranging from construction to shipbuilding, has denied the allegations. <p>Lee&#145;s tenure has also been marked by controversy as Samsung has been the focus of previous investigations. Lee was convicted in 1996, along with seven other leading South Korean business executives, of giving and arranging bribes to ex-South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, a former general. Lee was handed a two-year suspended prison term, meaning he did not serve time in jail. <p>Separately, Samsung Electronics said it earned 2.212 trillion won ($2.36 billion) in the three months through December, down 6.6 percent from the same period a year ago. <p>Samsung Electronics is the world&#145;s largest manufacturer of computer memory chips, and plays a leading global role in a range of electronics products including flat screen televisions. It ranks No. 2 in mobile phones behind Finland&#145;s&#145; Nokia Corp. <p>Samsung&#145;s share price rose as much as 3 percent Tuesday before paring gains as the broader stock market turned south to finish 1.3 percent higher at 532,000 won ($567). <p> AP Business Writer Kelly Olsen in Seoul contributed to this report.                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font>68<br>
