<p>ROME (AFP) &#x2014; Any doubts about whether or not former three-time world player of the year Ronaldo can still be a force in football were dispelled in just over 45 minutes on Sunday.</p><p>That was the time it took for Ronaldo to score twice and set up a third as AC Milan finally managed to secure their first home league win of the season.</p><p>After five draws, two defeats and a paltry three goals during the first half of the season, Napoli were the unfortunate victims as Milan scorched to a 5-2 victory.</p><p>It wasn't just about Ronaldo, though, as the European champions' new Brazilian attacking triumverate 'Ka-Pa-Ro' (Kaka, Pato and Ronaldo) combined for four of the five goals.</p><p>Fans have been talking about Milan's 21st century equivalent to their famous 1950s Swedish 'Gre-No-Li' partnership (Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm), and they didn't disappoint.</p><p>But it was the form of Ronaldo that most delighted Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti.</p><p>He latched onto an Andrea Pirlo pass to score the first goal, twice teed up Pato before Clarence Seedorf scored the second and then headed home a sumptuous cross from Seedorf 30 seconds after the break to notch the match-winner.</p><p>"We were fantastic, particularly Ronaldo," gushed Ancelotti. </p><p>"He is a phenomenon and he proved it even though he wasn't in great shape. </p><p>"Ronaldo started training on January 2 after six months of injuries. I'm happy for him, he's suffered a lot."</p><p>Ancelotti thrust Pato straight into the starting line-up for his debut and restored Ronaldo despite the striker - once unkindly nicknamed 'El Gordo' ('Fatty') during his time at Real Madrid - playing only 45 minutes of a friendly since his only other appearance of the season in late November.</p><p>"We took a risky attacking approach but it was vital as we need to claw back points," added the coach, alluding to Milan's 12th place in the league and 25-point deficit to leaders and bitter city rivals Inter Milan.</p><p>He was also delighted with Pato's contribution. The 18-year-old looked to be struggling a little before the break, missing two one-on-one chances in quick succession at one point.</p><p>But he grew as the game went on and took his chance with aplomb.</p><p>"Pato? He's got great ability. It was his first game, there's certain things to improve on but he proved he is very, very good."</p><p>Pato was delighted with how his first game went but he still deferred to his hero and strike partner.</p><p>"The team played really well," he said. "I want to dedicate my goal to my family and my girlfriend.</p><p>"Ronaldo is the true phenomenon, not me. I'm really happy to have scored. How many more can I get? I'll go to bed and have a think about that and talk about it another time."</p><p>Ronaldo may have won the plaudits from his own team but visiting coach Edy Reja was most impressed by Pato.</p><p>"I thought he would show his inexperience but instead he showed great maturity and mental strength," said Reja.</p>
