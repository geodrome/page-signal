<b><h3> Automakers roll out plug-in concepts

   <font size="3"> <br><br><p>					 	                     		                    <p>                                                                  By JEFF KAROUB, AP Business Writer                                                                  47 minutes ago                                                  		                          <!-- end storyhdr -->                          <p>                         DETROIT - Chrysler LLC on Monday rolled out three plug-in concept cars at the North American International Auto Show, the venue where rival General Motors Corp. made a splash one year ago with its Chevrolet Volt electric concept.                                                  <p>And Toyota said it plans to test hundreds of plug-ins with fleet and commercial customers worldwide by the same year. <p>"The automotive industry is trying to have this green image, but I don&#145;t see a true commitment ... where a company is taking a leadership role," said Thilo Koslowski, an automotive analyst for Gartner Inc. <p>Chrysler&#145;s entries in the concept race are Chrysler ecoVoyager, Dodge Zeo and Jeep Renegade. Officials say consumer demand isn&#145;t generated solely by technology. It also needs to come with distinctive designs &#151; in other words, no one-size-fits all approach. <p>Still, he said, they are purely concepts with no production guarantees. <p>GM hopes to have the Volt on the market by 2010 but is setting no firm date. This year, it&#145;s showing a similar plug-in hybrid concept that&#145;s a collaboration between Saturn and Opel. <p>Ford Motor Co. has a partnership with Southern California Edison to develop a small fleet of plug-in hybrids. The automaker delivered its first plug-in to the utility late last year. <p>The auto show also features Toyota&#145;s plug-in hybrid prototype, which, like the current Prius, switches from pure electric to gas engine to a blended gas electric mode. But the plug-in has a second battery pack that allows it to store greater levels of electricity and is capable of operating in pure electric mode for longer periods of time and at much higher speeds. <p>Even upstarts are getting in on the act. California-based Fisker Automotive announced Monday it will begin producing a plug-in sports car in late 2009. The Fisker Karma will cost around $80,000, with projected sales of 15,000 per year. <p> Many automakers say this time, the market is ready for electrics. The 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise and fall of GM&#145;s EV1 and offerings from Toyota and Audi. <p> Koslowski, who worked for Audi, said it&#145;s true that there wasn&#145;t as strong demand then. But he also blames the automakers for not promoting the technology or accepting lower profit margins in the short term as they boosted investment in batteries and other technology necessary to make it happen. <p> "Why didn&#145;t we do this before? The simple answer is nobody really forced the automakers to make these changes," he said. "The fact that we haven&#145;t had changes over the past couple of decades is shameful." <p> Troy Clarke, GM&#145;s North American president, said that GM fully understands the technological pitfalls of electric vehicles, such as the limited range of the batteries. <p> He said the technological timing is right, and comes at the convergence of three trends: concern over climate change, the need for U.S. energy independence and the high costs of oil. <p> "You don&#145;t really need anybody to convince you that this is the right time to start doubling down on your bets with this type of technology," he said. <p> ___ <p> Associated Press Writer Ken Thomas and Auto Writers Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this report.                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font><br><!-- (c) 2003, 2005 PHPNews - http://newsphp.sourceforge.net/ -->
