Human rights advocates plan to protest a float honoring the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and anti-war activists, including "Peace Mom" Cindy Sheehan, intend to rally for peace.                                                  <p>Volunteers have busy in Pasadena and nearby areas this past week decorating the floats with buckets of flowers and seeds. <p>The National Weather Service forecast no rain for Tuesday&#145;s parade, with highs in the low 70s and not much wind. <p>"Honestly, in the past years, it&#145;s really been more about floats breaking down, delaying the parade, than other things, than protests," said Tournament of Roses President CL Keedy. <p>"If controversy like this diminishes the positive impact of the Rose Parade, it would be of concern," Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard said. <p>Bogaard said the city cited security considerations in turning down the group&#145;s proposal for a demonstration along the parade route involving a large band and several vehicles. <p>Protest organizer John Li, a member of Caltech&#145;s chapter of Falun Gong, the spiritual movement outlawed by the Chinese government in 1999, promised his group would be seen if not heard. <p>The float is sanctioned by the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee but is sponsored by the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations and Pasadena-based label maker Avery Dennison Corp. It will feature the upcoming Olympics&#145; five official mascots rotating on a base and decorated with a combination of flowers, including carnations and daisy petals. <p>As many as 1,000 supporters are expected to rally before and after the parade and distribute 20,000 pamphlets while flying 300 banners along the parade route, said Peter Thottam, executive director of the Los Angeles National Impeachment Center. <p> "We&#145;ve had to ramp up our resources, police personnel, but nothing out of the ordinary," police Commander Paul Gales said. <p> ___ <p> On the Net: <p> Rose Parade: http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font><br><!-- (c) 2003, 2005 PHPNews - http://newsphp.sourceforge.net/ -->
