<p>January 10, 2008. A Thursday like never before. Ratan Tata&#8217;s dream &#8216;car for the masses&#8217; Nano is unveiled in front of a packed audience at  Pragati Maidan. The true people&#8217;s car can actually sit four persons and still travel around 22 kilometres for Rs 48 (cost of one litre of petrol). </p>
<p> It will cost you Rs 1.3 lakh to own one. But the big question is: When  will it actually arrive at your place? Looking at the mass hysteria, it might  take as long as mid-2010. Now how am I connected to all this? I happened to be there on the day little Nano was revealed to the world. Unfortunately, the first day of the 9th Auto Expo was a media day, and I didn&#8217;t know that. </p>
<font class=subsectionhead size=3 color=red>                
Chance of a lifetime
</font>                                                     
<p></p>                                                     
</P>
<p> Once near the expo,  a policeman rudely  brought me back to my senses. Helpless, I looked on to catch a glimpse of a known face. Some minutes passed by. No media card, no identity proof, except my card, stating that I worked for a Chennai company, and which was of little use. Finally, by sheer luck I  bumped into Mr K. Swamy &#8212; connected with a component manufacturers association  and one of the organisers &#8212;  at the entrance. A smile and a few words later, I was in, with Mr Swamy leading  the way. Now, as we entered the enclosure that spanned  halls 2 to 6, I was amazed to see so many cars and people. This was  my first visit  to an auto expo. Vehicles of all shapes and sizes &#8212; commercial utility vehicles, buses, small trucks and two-wheelers &#8212; were parked all around, and the place was teeming with  media-persons. But my eyes were on the cars,  especially  on the one waiting to claim the crown of &#8216;cheapest car&#8217; from  Chinese automaker Chery Automobiles.  At the over 5,000 sq m Tata Motors stall,   hundreds of  media persons waited with bated breath. The hour had come. </p>
<font class=subsectionhead size=3 color=red>                
The Interview
</font>                                                     
<p></p>                                                     
</P>
<p>As Mr Ratan Tata, Mr Krishna Kant and a few others from Tata Motors stood by, the white Nano rolled down the aisle,  as if happy by the euphoria that was all too evident. And then I met the 38-year-old   Girish Wagh, the brain behind the car we all are so proud of. Here comes the interesting part. He talked to me and I recorded it on tape.  Here is the unedited version of my <em style="i">t&#234;te-&#192;-t&#234;te</em> with the head of Tata Motors&#8217; Engineering Research Centre. </p>
<p>Me: (nervous) Congratulations, Mr Wagh, on an excellent car. You have changed the game.</p>
<p>Girish: Thank you so much. It&#8217;s what a team of dedicated individuals can do!</p>
<p>Me: How could you achieve something that was well-nigh impossible. Everybody said&#8230;</p>
<p>Girish: (while shaking hands with  journalists) Cost reduction, ensuring quality standards and, finally, a car that was safe on the roads. And yes, a kind of performance that was demonstrable. </p>
<p>Me: But between the announcements made by Ratan Tata in 2005 and now, input costs rose&#8230; (had to repeat the question again &#8212; natural ambience effect!) </p>
<p>Girish: Costs can be reduced with a change in procurement tactics. Internet auctions, adhesives in place of costly welding, size, a rear engine (reduces length of engine compartment) all played a role. Components from suppliers, my team and continuous R&amp;D made sure that it is a safe vehicle. </p>
<p>Me: What was your biggest challenge? </p>
<p>Girish: (pausing more a moment) The truck (Ace) was a different experience for me. But Nano already had the price tag. We had to virtually back-calculate. We couldn&#8217;t do anything to go through the target. Packaging was also critical. A bit of additional weight meant everything had to be done again. </p>
<p>Me: Do you think the low-cost Nano will help make Tata Motors more profitable?</p>
<p>Girish: Are you talking about margins? I am not the right person to talk about that&#8230;but the car is in front of you. As Mr Tata said, it&#8217;s been created to cater to the needs of the family that was travelling on a scooter. We think it has great potential. </p>
<p>Me: But everything was not as rosy for the company even five years ago. What changed?</p>
<p>Girish: (After a conversation with a colleague, who possibly told him to finish quickly) We were bleeding in 2000. Costs could be rationalised. At a meeting Mr Kant told us to bring it down by 10 per cent. We finally hit the right buttons. As an organisation, we changed rapidly. Nano&#8230;it&#8217;s not just a new car but a new way of doing things. </p>
<p>Me: I won&#8217;t detain you any longer. Just a final question. Any regrets on any aspect of the project?</p>
<p>Girish: None at all. I had the best team to work with. Leaders who were always there and a nascent desire to make one man&#8217;s dream a reality. </p>
<p>Me: No concerns, then&#8230;</p>
<p>Girish: (as he left) If I had, we wouldn&#8217;t have brought out the product. It&#8217;s completely safe and  delivers on the  promise: The 1 lakh car&#8230;</p>
<p>God was kind to me later that day. It turned out during lunch that some auto component company executives were talking to Mr Wagh. Suddenly the gloomy faces of the representatives of the auto component industry had vanished. Singur can do 2.5 lakh now as far as capacity is concerned. Another lakh might be added, and so too can other manufacturing locations. Didn&#8217;t record this part but will let my readers trust my good memory anyway.</p>
<p>Me: Hi Girish, hope I&#8217;m not disturbing again.</p>
<p>Girish: No. Please.</p>
<p>Me: Some say you guys just wanted to corner a share of the three-wheeler market.</p>
<p>Girish: (in a non-resentful way) It&#8217;s okay. People drive vehicles but a car is a much better option than a three-wheeler. Everybody wants to make the small car. India has potholes on city roads. In many villages, we don&#8217;t even have roads. Ace succeeded hugely because customers knew it was what they wanted. With Nano, four wheels can do the job of two. </p>
<p>Me: Steve Jobs may be angry with Tata Motors. Nobody will talk about iPod nano in India&#8230;</p>
<p>Girish: (Laughing) That&#8217;s a first. Anyway we have applied for 34 patents for the powertrain design and once granted, they will be for the Tata Nano. Nano is small or the smallest. It&#8217;s 8 per cent smaller than the next bigger competitor! Everything has innovation written on it. From windshield wipers, rear engine layout, spacious design, fuelling system and  tubeless tyres. I believe, Apple will be happy, not sad. </p>
<p>I had to discontinue the conversation but it left an indelible mark on my mind. What Americans, Japanese and even the mighty Chinese couldn&#8217;t do&#8230;we Indians have. While well-known activist Sunita Narain  might be shouting from the rooftop about  pollution and the environment, Tata claims that Nano complies with Bharat Stage-III and even stringent Euro-IV emission benchmarks. </p>
<p>The Tata Group cannot build roads; that the government has to do. Levy taxes for each use of the affordable car, as author Tim Harford suggested in his 2005 book <em style="i">The Undercover Economist</em>. That your car&#8217;s down payment is the full payment doesn&#8217;t merely suggest low-cost but points to the way things are going to be done from now on. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new world for manufacturers of not only cars but for everybody who can tie up resources smartly. Consumer is the king, finally. More importantly, the &#8216;Nano way&#8217; of empowering a younger generation to lead innovation could well be the new way for tired managements of aging companies to surge through in these fiercely competitive times. </p>

<p>Responses to Episode-173 on the issue: &#8216;Should social networking sites be banned in office?&#8217; (Business Line, January 7, 2008). </p><p>There is no use in blaming only social networking sites for eating away the productive time of employees. To achieve the desired results, employers should limit the Internet timings in their offices. </p><p>I have my own reservations about the social networking sites. If you happened to meet your old friend or colleague through this network it is okay. But most of the users of these social networking sites always look for strangers and try to make them friends. I see them as virtual hypocrites, as most of them try to avoid eye contact even with their neighbours but &#8216;seriously&#8217; look for friendship in the virtual world. </p><p>V. Ramaswamy, Noida </p><p>There are many valid reasons for employees to use social networking sites at workplace. </p><p>The 80-20 rule holds well in almost all the offices, 80 per cent of the effective workload is shared by 20 per cent of the employees. </p><p>A good number of senior managers delegate most of their jobs including the presentation part. </p><p>Middle level executives are locked into their office chairs for 12-16 hours, and mostly it is seven days a week for them. Their commuting time on average is about two hours per day. </p><p>The social animals therefore need more than coffee/lunch breaks&#8230;viz: social networking and using of cell phone during office hours. </p><p>Organisations have to keep in mind the impact on 80 per cent of the work, before questioning any individual on the usage of Office networks for personal breaks. </p><p>Krishnamoorthy, Mangalore</p><p>It is a fact that in majority of the offices Internet is being used for purposes, beyond what is being required officially. One is networking sites. The other major villain is online trading. The second issue poses a problem on weekdays, during the market hours. It is certainly diversion of precious resources of the organisations. While a marginal amount of digression may help in removing the boredom of office, it can be taken care of by certain HR initiatives. Having Internet control and usage policy is the need of the day. </p><p>Krithivasan, e-mail</p><p>Two years back I had a chance to do a project in Dubai. In that company, access to the Net was absolutely unrestricted. After a month&#8217;s time, their net bill shot up. The reason was employees started downloading songs, uploading videos, etc. Then the company had a meeting with employees and enhanced the downloadable capacity but advised the staff not to download large files. The staff accepted the reason behind that and acted prudently. </p><p>Ramji, Chennai </p>
