<h2>Benitez lines up transfer targets</h2>

<!-- E IIMA -->
<!-- S SF -->
<B>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez says he will be among the managers looking to make new signings when the transfer window reopens on New Year's Day.</B>
<P>
Manchester United have already signed Angolan striker Manucho and Tottenham  have brought in Chris Gunter in deals which can now be formally completed.
<P>
Struggling Derby say they are looking  to sign "four or five" new players to help their fight against relegation.
<P>
But Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has ruled out making any major signings.
<!-- E SF -->
<P>
Benitez had a high-profile falling out with Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett over his plans for the transfer window earlier this season.
<P>
But relations appear to have smoothed sufficiently for Benitez to be entrusted with further transfer funds.
<P>

            <b>606: DEBATE</b><br />
            
                    What players do Liverpool need to sign?
            
            <br />

<P>
"We have some players, have some targets and we will try to sign the players we need," he said. 
<P>
"Maybe we will bring in one, maybe two, if everyone is fit you never know. We are working hard and are very close."
<P>
The impact of African Cup of Nations call-ups later this month is likely to force many managers into action, with Portsmouth potentially down to just 14 senior players.
<P>
Pompey will be without the likes of Kanu, Lauren, Papa Bouba Diop, Benjani Mwaruwari and Sulley Muntari.
<P>
Sunderland boss Roy Keane has been linked with numerous players, including Blackburn's Robbie Savage, but would not be drawn on any specific targets.
<P>
"There have been plenty of players linked with us. I would say in the last month maybe something like 20 or 25," said Keane.
<P>
"I don't think we will be signing 25 players, let me tell you. It would be wrong for me to comment on a player under contract at another football club."
