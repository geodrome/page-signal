But shuttle program manager Wayne Hale indicated last week that the launch likely would be delayed after a test pointed to a bad connector. <p>"At this point, schedule is not paramount in my mind," he said. "It&#145;s going to take as long as it takes ... days to perhaps a couple weeks. We have to get our hands around exactly what work needs to be done." <p>Senior NASA managers decided Thursday to remove a plug and electrical connector from the tank and send it to an Alabama testing facility to be studied and repaired, Hale said. <p>The space agency has been struggling with sporadic fuel gauge problems for two years, ever since flights resumed following the 2003 Columbia tragedy. The gauges prevent the shuttle&#145;s main engines from running on an empty tank, which could be catastrophic. <p>                                                   	 		 					 	                     		                    <p>                                                                  By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer                                                                 Sat Dec 29, 10:10 AM ET                                                  		                          <!-- end storyhdr -->                          <p>                         HOUSTON - The space shuttle Atlantis&#145; mission to the international space station likely will be pushed back a few more days or weeks as engineers study problems with electrical connectors in the spaceship&#145;s external fuel tank, a top NASA manager said Thursday.                                                  <p>NASA had been aiming for a Jan. 10 liftoff of Atlantis with a European lab for the space station.
