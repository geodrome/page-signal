<span class="title">Fight!  Fight!  Fight!</span>

<p>So, uh, heard about any upcoming elections of import?</p>

<p>The post-Christmas dash to the finish line for the Presidential nominations - or finish <em>lines</em> as things actually unfold - is on.  With abandon.</p>

<p>Given the multi-candidate field, duking it out in a variety of states, the race for the GOP nod has now devolved into a veritable blizzard of haymakers in all directions.</p>

<p>Now granted, things aren't really rough yet.  But it's getting there, and fast.  The bulk of the buzz and political coverage is around assorted TV ads so this long post is heavy on them. Accordingly, here are the most significant developments shaping the race for the next week leading up to the Iowa caucuses:</p>

<p>1)  <u>Mike Huckabee is running an unorthodox campaign</u>.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks of not fighting back against the sea of attacks from fellow candidates and heightened scrutiny from the press, he emerged out of the brief Christmas respite to air his same old, "vote for me because I'm a Christian" ad:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/BjtGgfhKIvo&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/BjtGgfhKIvo&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p>

<p>The ad was indeed a great mass media introduction of Mike Huckabee to the Evangelical-heavy Iowa caucus-goer demographic.  Emphasis on <em>was</em>.  Now it just smells of "I need to hold my base intact because it ain't growing."</p>

<p>But then just yesterday, Huckabee's campaign unleashed two different ads to augment his rotation.  The first is an obvious effort to just play "Mr. Nice," don't talk about the multitude of issues being brought to bear against him, and essentially run out the clock asking the overly nice Iowans to vote for his overly nice personage:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wqi-pDhHv9g&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/wqi-pDhHv9g&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p>

<p>The 2nd ad is more bizarre:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TRnSx9rBgcw&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TRnSx9rBgcw&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>The spot is clearly designed to respond to the hits Huckabee has been taking on taxes and crime, but the response - primarily via on-screen messaging - is overshadowed by the "Founding Fathers" dialogue from the candidate, which makes little sense in the context of the current campaign dialogue.  More importantly, if a candidate is going to respond to attacks against him he should either a) have a very solid, direct comeback on the topic at hand or b) punch back hard on a different subject to change the conversation.  Huckabee is doing neither.</p>

<p>2)  <u>Iowa appears to be tightening</u>, which makes Huckabee's focus even more peculiar.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/ia/iowa_republican_caucus-207.html" target="_blank">RealClearPolitics Iowa average</a> shows Huckabee's lead down to the low-single digits, down from a robust double-digit margin earlier in the month.  Moreover, the three pollsters who have been in the field most often the last two months, Strategic Vision, Rasmussen, and ARG, show the gap shrinking from anywhere between a 6-13% Huckabee advantage down to only a 2% Huckabee margin, and perhaps even a Romney lead, in their latest surveys.  Forget the specific numbers (which are devilishly difficult to predict anyway), three regular pollsters showing the same trend is the story [<strong>UPDATE:</strong>  since this post was originally composed, two more polls from Zogby and Maxon Dixon have been added to the RealClearPolitics link above, supporting the same trend.  Of course, now we enter the closing days where last minute voter shifts can be volatile so take it all with a grain of salt].</p>

<p>The race is tightening in part due to Huckabee's oblique strategy discussed above, a steady spat of negative and/or mixed media stories, the Club for Growth's continued hits on taxes, and a steady stream of "contrast" ads from Mitt Romney.  Here's the latest:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KpoPRA3pFjg&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/KpoPRA3pFjg&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p>

<p>The astute reader will recognize that such "contrast" ads are pretty tame stuff in the world of politics, but this is Iowa, famous for its dislike of negative campaigns.  Note, for example, the negative information on Huckabee is conveyed by a soft, gentle female voice.  Either way, no candidate can hold their ground in the face of a well-funded onslaught without responding in some way.  Huckabee isn't quite doing that.  But...</p>

<p>3)...<u>now a 3rd party group supporting Huck is responding for him</u>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1207/ProHuck_group_goes_up_on_Iowa_TV_hitting_Mitt.html" target="_blank">"Trust Huck" is picking up the slack</a> after a couple weeks of Huckabee taking punches.  This is a more classic attack ad, complete with mocking laughter in the background:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UeUK0N6D3co&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UeUK0N6D3co&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p>

<p>If any likely caucus goer finds that to be new information I'd be surprised, but it's another voice in the cacophony of political messaging that isn't hurting Huckabee at least (though note in the coverage provided at the link above that the ad buy is rather small).  Now the candidate has to stop hurting himself.</p>

<p>4)  <u>Huckabee wishes the caucuses were starting...now</u>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1207/Huck_needs_the_caucuses_to_be_now_or_yesterday.html " target="_blank">Jonathan Martin has it right</a>.  It increasingly looks like Huckabee has hit a peak and is trying to play keep-away with a shrinking lead.  Furthermore, the candidate is causing a number of his own problems, particularly on foreign policy.  </p>

<p>If Mitt Romney has been teetering for months on the press running with a theme of "this guy is a phony," Mike Huckabee is now perilously close to the edge of a similar such precipice where the media starts saying "this guy doesn't know what he's talking about."  Powerline summed up <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2007/12/019397.php" target="_blank">a series of foreign policy gaffes</a>, CNN got <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-BOgBan-Fc " target="_blank">a Huckabee adviser admitting his candidate is flawed</a>, and <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7602.html" target="_blank">John Bolton is now contradicting Huckabee's claims</a> that he ever advised the candidate on foreign policy.  Needless to say, this is not the kind of environment one wants before <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1207/Huckabee_rolls_the_dice.html " target="_blank">appearing on Meet the Press this coming Sunday</a>.</p>

<p>5)  <u>The Mitt v. McCain war is on</u>.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time.  Anyone who saw the heavy sniping between the two campaigns prior to McCain's summertime implosion knew there was bad blood brewing.  With McCain gaining ground in New Hampshire, in part thanks to Giuliani's slide, a donnybrook was bound to happen.  It has.</p>

<p>Romney began the escalation after Christmas, turning his on-the-campaign-trail barbs into another polite "contrast" ad:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-E0G4xwDGCI&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-E0G4xwDGCI&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>McCain rapidly went to DEFCON 1 with his response:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJUdMJIKnTs&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJUdMJIKnTs&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p>

<p>The ad is interesting on a several levels.  One, McCain calling Romney a phony is like Romney calling McCain a prick.  Both charges can be substantiated, at least enough for a campaign ad.  But it's over the top given the current tone of the campaign debate.  Second, <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2007/12/019386.php" target="_blank">McCain isn't actually responding on any of the issues for which he is being critiqued</a> by Romney; probably because his campaign knows they don't have a good comeback on the merits.  Third, the sourcing and content of the ad feed into a theme McCain's campaign is pushing, either on purpose or inadvertently:  "the media loves me."  McCain's other current New Hampshire ad reeks of it:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uyZADaSM1p4&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uyZADaSM1p4&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object> </p>

<p>Pimping a candidate's newspaper endorsements to the campaign's advantage is of course a time-honored tradition.  But the feel of the later stages of this election cycle is increasingly beginning to revert to the media adoration of McCain that left a goodly number of Republicans feeling nauseous in 2000.</p>

<p>For now, Romney is punching right back at McCain.  Not quite as harshly, but taking McCain's number one problem with likely Republican primary voters and laying it all out:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WmhaypWwFPY&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WmhaypWwFPY&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object> </p>

<p>Whatever happens in Iowa, New Hampshire is going to be an absolute slugfest from January 4th - 8th.</p>

<p>6)  <u>Romney <em>has</em> to win Iowa</u>.</p>

<p>Sure, there are ways he could still win the nomination if he doesn't.  Yet McCain is close enough now in New Hampshire - with <a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/12/romney_takes_the_plunge.php " target="_blank">the local media cheering him on</a> -  that it seems highly improbable Romney could absorb the inevitable press hit of finishing even a very close second in Iowa without losing the Granite State too.</p>

<p>With Huckabee's continued stumbles in recent weeks, it increasingly looks like the winner of New Hampshire will be the favorite to win the nomination against Huckabee and his core of Evangelical voters into which he seems to be sequestering himself.  It won't be guaranteed, but the winner of New Hampshire probably wins Michigan too.  That's a whole lot of mo' heading into South Carolina, Florida, and beyond. </p>

<b>4.</b> I hope so, Travis @ 2.  Ignoring the number-one money-raiser in the race doesn't make Eric's analysis look very complete, and raises the question: why does Eric ignore Ron Paul?</p>

<p>Ron Paul's campaign is near $19 million raised for the 4th quarter alone.  He has another money-bomb coming on 12/31/07 which could put him over $20 million.  </p>

<p>I predict he will be second or third in Iowa, and first or second in NH.  He will be in the race all the way to the convention, and will be allowed to speak.  Who knows what could happen? </p>

<p>In any case, he is definitely a factor in the race, and should be a part of any article that seeks to understand the race's dynamics.  But Eric ignores him.  Strange.</p>

<b>5.</b> My thought is Eric genuinely just does not think that Pauls votes, supporters, bumperstickers, signs, straw poll wins, blimps, volunteers in Iowa and NH (and every other state), etc... will just not translate into votes.  I do not think he is like some of the elite media such as Fox News who know how well he is doing and is trying to exclude him because of fear rather than ignorance.</p>

<b>7.</b> Alternatively, Eric could be going by the public polling - generally more representative of the final results than any of those other factors involved - especially Paul's astronomical "will not considers."</p>

<p>I don't have any vitriol against Doctor-Congressman Paul, but...well...American optimism sure is alive and well in many of Paul's supporters.  That's the kindest way I can put it.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I look forward to Paul's results.  He is running the first campaign of its type, ever.  It may change politics forever.  I highly doubt he will place first anywhere, or even second.  But it will tell us a lot about whether this is an effective strategy, or ends up in the <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> Internet meme wastebin.</p>

<b>8.</b> It is true that Dr Pauls campaign has not hit #1 in any of the 'scientific polls' but as you also point out, times have changed.  Pauls campaign is different from others but only in that new technology has matured enough to allow a traditional grassroots campaign to compete with a corporate media campaign.  Grassroots campaigns are not new.  It is the technology that is new.</p>

<p>But as technology has allowed polls to progress, scientific polls have not.  THey are still conducted on landlines and are thus becoming obsolete.  There is much speculation that Pauls supporters are much less likely to have a landline than other candidates supporters.  </p>

<p>There is also bias in the scientific polls created when they decide who to poll.  Often their definition of a 'likely republican voter' is 'voted in the 2004 republican primary'  But ask yourself who voted in the 2004 republican primary and compare that with who we expect to show up this year and you will see there is a big disconnect.</p>

<p>But I would also argue that even without the changes in technology, the polls have traditionally been worthless in predicting the winners of races.  Kerry had 5% up till mid december in 04.  Clinton was something similar in 1992.  Bush lost Iowa and NH if I remember correcting in 2000.  What does this mean?  It means polls give the media things to talk about but even the most meaningful polls (NH and IA primaries) are not the be all end all of who will come out on top.</p>

<b>9.</b> Travis,</p>

<p>You raise interesting theoretical points, but I'm unconvinced that this will affect the final result in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>The cell phone issue is a valid one.  Youths are increasingly converting to not using landlines, and this is not taken into account in telephone surveys.  But with Paul's polling numbers, there would have to be:</p>

<p>1) Unusually strong turnout among youth voters</p>

<p>2) A strong Paul victory among these voters (which polls don't show to be happening among youth voters with landlines)</p>

<p>3) A striking underestimation in current exclusive cell phone usership statistics.</p>

<p>I doubt the stars will align that favorably for Congressman Paul.  It is not that it is impossible, but the predictions people like Mr. Guthrie are making require a suspension of belief and a belief in the power of the Cause.  That makes for good newsletter fodder, but I don't think it's a sound political prediction.</p>

<p>The "likely Republican" issue is an interesting factor too.  We'll see, on that.  Some polling companies determine "likely voters" by asking about past participation and a few other questions.  Others just outright ask if the voter is likely to participate.  Since I haven't seen Paul performing incredibly strongly in the latter, I'll assume that this is another probable non-poll breaking issue.</p>

<p>Certainly, the political climate is a dynamic one and you are right that fortunes can change.  But Congressman Paul's negatives are the highest of any candidate, among General and Primary voters.  He has "will not considers" near 50 percent.  There is a similar strand among all the candidates you mentioned, and it's that their "will not considers" were never that high.</p>

<p>If you want to read more on the cell phone issue in voting, there was an excellent article on an academic journal called <i>Political Behavior</i> a while back.  I'll try to dig it up next time I have access to a university database.  It's a very strong case for this being an issue that pollsters need to address, but not yet one that affects the outcomes of polls heavily - yet.</p>

<b>10.</b> It's just so simple.  Paul is a clown.  His supporters are wackos.  The mods are right to ignore Paul's "campaign". Don't feed the trolls.</p>

<p>The thing that surprises me most in all of this is the Giuliani slide.  Caucuses are generally dominated by extremists, real political junkies.  In republican circles that frequently translate to religious/true-believer activists.  Hence WA's caucuses nominating Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson a few cycles back.  Sure a low point in a state's political history filled with low points.  A Huck surge is no surprise.  I would have expected Edwards to do better.  Giuliani never had much of a chance in IA.  But Rudy's big drop nationally is more of a surprise.  I felt like it started when he and Mitt got into that squabble over Mitt's yard company hiring illegals.  Rudy looked really punk on that one.  I wonder if that one faux pas started a chain reaction?</p>

<p>Also interesting is the heat on the Dem side of the aisle.  They are getting more, bigger contributions than the GOP.  More celebrities on the stump (the Chuck-strich not withstanding http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzhfkJHq7SY ).  So many of the pundits have asserted that the dems have the fire this year, which will lead to their inevitable victory.</p>

<p>But I am not convinced of that logic.  It's not that all of the GOP candidates are more flawed for the GOP base than the Dem candidates, I think it is that the GOP has such a STRONG field that the GOP base will be pretty happy with ANY of the top tier candidates.  Look for the GOP base to get REALLY fired up AFTER each side has their candidate.  I suspect that the Dems are hitting to hard now, and may punch themselves out for the general.  We can but hope.</p>

<b>11.</b> Travis,</p>

<p>By the way, just for information:</p>

<p>- In the General, Bush lost Iowa and won New Hampshire in 2000; they flipped in 2004, and New Mexico became Republican, as well.</p>

<p>- In the Primary, Bush won Iowa in 2000 by about 10 points.  He lost only the New England states (save Maine), Arizona and Michigan.</p>

<b>12.</b> Don't you get a sick feeling in your stomach when Romney pulls out all that dough and uses it on attack ads against all the other candidates?  Huckabee sticking up for McCain is a sign of things to come.  Romney will now have to stop the attack ads and switch to more personal biographical stuff.  If he doesn't do it, McCain and Huckabee form a temp partnership, Romney sinks in Iowa, McCain takes NH and Rudy is free to compete in Florida and super Tuesday.</p>

<b>14.</b> The assumption that the winner of New Hampshire then beats Huckabee for the nomination ignores that Giuliani is still in the race at least through Florida. If Rudy wins there, he probably will win more delegates on February 5th than anyone else since he has large leads in NY, NJ, and significant leads in California, Illinois and others.</p>

<p>The current notion that the candidate who continues to lead in the Real Clear Politics Average of polls is a dead duck and not worth mentioning is remarkable. A lot of people are not even focused on word wars between Huck, Mitt, and John. They do however remember who cleaned up NY, was named Times Man of the Year and lead a lot better response to 9/11 than we see in response to other catastrophic events such as Katrina and the Bhutto assasination</p>

<b>17.</b> In the comments section of an <a href=" http://soundpolitics.com/public/2007/12/ron_paul_vs_lincoln_and_reagan.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">earlier PublicBlog thread</a> (and elsewhere on SoundPolitics and other blogs), some libertarians and some Ron Paul supporters refer to President Lincoln as a tyrant and voice strong opposition to the Lincoln's war policy, his governmental philosophy, and his actions to defeat the pro-slavery secessionists in the Civil War.</p>

<p>I don't agree with this characterization of Lincoln and the other early leaders and founders of the Republican Party, but I've discussed that issue <a href="http://www.steveberen.com/790976.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>In my opinion, we have seen true tyranny in the 20th and 21st centuries - in Nazism, Japanese Imperialism, the evil Soviet empire, and in today's Islamic fascism (which I consider the focus of evil in the modern world.)</p>

<p>Although the Soviet Union fell apart, and although many Eastern European countries and former Soviet Republics have overturned communism, we see tyranny today in Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere - including in the western hemisphere (witness Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Fidel Castro in Cuba).</p>

<p>While it is hyperbole of the most extreme sort to call Lincoln a tyrant, Chavez and Castro are real, living tyrants, posing a serious foreign policy threat for America.  The question of how to deal with Cuba and Venezuela came up in the December 9 GOP presidential debate in Miami.</p>

<p>I've watched every minute of every GOP presidential debate - except for this one, which was broadcast in Spanish.  But I did read the entire transcript, which is available on line courtesy of the Wall Street Journal at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23brb7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/23brb7</a></p>

<p>In the course of the debate, Ron Paul was questioned directly about U.S. policy toward Latin America, and discussed the twin advocates of socialist tyranny in his remarks.  </p>

<p>Two excerpts from the transcript are posted below to show Paul's comments and the audience reaction.  Based on just the transcript, the reaction of the audience was mixed - booing and applause.  Many in the audience evidently knew first hand, or at least from the experience of their families, of the actual tyranny existing today in communist Cuba.  You can't tell from the transcript whether the booing or applause predominated.  However, by going to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/33c3ae" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">90 second video clip</a> of Congressman Paul's comments, you can judge the audience reaction for yourself.</p>

<p>Also, Michelle Malkin has extensive commentary (with strong criticisms of Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, and Rudy Giuliani and praise for Duncan Hunter) on the debate at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yog89j" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yog89j</a></p>

<p>Here are the excerpts from Ron Paul's comments:</p>

<p><strong>EXCERPT #1</strong><br />
<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> ....Now we're going to talk about Latin America. A week ago, exactly a week ago, Venezuela rejected changes to the constitution, but the president, Hugo Chavez...  President Hugo Chavez has insisted that he's going to propose them again. Many consider him a threat to democracy in the region. If you were elected president, how would you deal with Chavez? Let's start with Congressman [Ron] Paul....</p>

<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN PAUL:</strong> Well, he's not the easiest person to deal with, but we should deal with everybody around the world the same way: with friendship and opportunity to talk and try to trade with people.  (AUDIENCE BOOING)  We talked to -- we talked to Stalin, we talked to Khrushchev, we've talked to Mao, and we've talked to the world, and we get along with people.  Actually, I believe we're at a time where we even ought to talk to Cuba and trade and travel to Cuba.  (AUDIENCE BOOING) (APPLAUSE)</p>

<p><strong>EXCERPT #2</strong><br />
<strong>CONGRESSMAN PAUL:</strong> But ... let me tell you why we have a problem in South America and Central America: because we've been involved in their internal affairs for so long. We have been meddling in their business.  (APPLAUSE)  We create the Chavezes of the world, we create the Castros of the world by interfering and creating chaos in their countries....  (AUDIENCE BOOING) (APPLAUSE)</p>

<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Congressman.</p>

<p>In addition to the three people you think pauls support is limited to, I wonder where the 150,000 people who have donated to Paul will vote for too.</p>

<p>Just so you know, saying there are only a few people supporting Paul is about 5 tactics old.  The rest of the public has moved past it and on to laughing at him, ridiculing him, calling him racist, calling him a hypocrit, trying to pretend he is dishonest, and lastly ignoring him again after non of the other methods worked.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<b>19.</b> First off to Eric:  I usually find you opinions very fair, but your Romney bias shows through.  You don't bother to point out that Romney's ad against McCain in NH is patently false.  McCain never supported Amnesty as Romney states in the Ad (this is a common misconception, especially with Romney defining Amnesty however he wants to -- someone needs to call him on this).  Second, Romney himself supported the immigration plan as defined by McCain, before he saw that it would cost him election points, at which point he flip-flopped on the issue.  Romney has a history of flip-flops and he wonders why the Concord newspaper calls him a phony.  He is a phony.  He makes Kerry look like a choir boy when it comes to flip-flops.</p>

<p>Now to Bruce:  I find it hard to believe that RP will finish 2nd in Iowa.  Isn't that quite the stretch.  Having money is one thing, but having organization is another.  Romney is credited with having the most eleborate Iowa organization with purchasing district organizors to make sure his voters get out.  Too bad he is spending money on TV Ads, he could be wiser to use it to fund people getting to the caucuses.  Hillary is purchasing shovels for people who may get snowed in, and also working with grocery stores to make up sandwiches for the caucuses to make them more a social event that the small-town folk will come out to.  Huckabee's strength is strong with the home-school crowd and pastor network.  I see the rest of the candidates vying for third, which most likely will be Fred Thompson.</p>

<p>Now in New Hampshire, I am also unsure where you think RP will make it any higher than third.  Romney has the core Republican base.  McCain will sow up the anti-Romney Republican crowd and the Republican leaning Independents.  The Anti-war independents will most likely vote for Obama in the Democratic Primary, since it will also be a three way fight.  Ron Paul's core of libertarian leaning Republicans isn't big enough to carry him any higher than third and will be torn between Romney and Ron Paul.  If Romney wins Iowa, then they will lean Romney (get behind a winner).  The only scenario that I see Ron Paul capturing this crowd will be if (1) Huckabee wins Iowa, and (2) Ron Paul actually uses some of the money he has and purchases massive media advertising this week.  He can't wait until Iowa and he can't afford to sit on the money.  NH is do or die for Ron Paul.  If he doesn't come in third, he may have the money to compete, but will be shut out of the free media air time.</p>

<p>One other tidbit, the other day, I see where Ron Paul did agree with Huckabee when asked about evolution.  Ron Paul doesn't agree that evolution is a given fact.  It is a scientific theory, but has a lot of holes that have yet to be proven.  If anyone looked at it independently they would see that its adherents show the same level of faith that comes with religion and not the level of scrutiny and reserved judgement that comes with science.  They want to believe that evolution is fact because they fear the opposite.  They have blinders on when judging the actual facts and are willing to make jumps in logic/theory to fill in the blanks that can only be equated to a leap of faith.</p>

<p>Finally, if Ron Paul is for small or minimal government, why did he submit items for earmark funding?  McCain didn't submit any earmarks and has been fighting government spending for years.</p>

<b>21.</b> Travis,</p>

<p>1. One has to look behind the numbers and ask some questions about financial support. Here is the theory:</p>

<p>a. Paul's support comes from a collection of really odd bedfellows. First there are the young disaffected like you who respond to a libertarian message, then there are the hate groups like the Nazis, Aryan Nation, and KKK, and probably one of the most successful astroturf campaigns in history run by Soros, Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance operatives because their real goal is to elect Hillary. They want either Paul as the republican nominee or a third party. The only way Hillary can be elected because of her negatives is to have a large number of votes siphoned from republicans.</p>

<p>b. Is this a real donation? One of the the senate candidates in this state loaned his campaign money and then paid himself back. Perfectly legal, I might add.</p>

<p>2. This is the post I made on another thread. The quote is Bruce G's actual words:</p>

<p>Bruce,</p>

<p>So, does Ron Paul plan to answer Medved's letter and does he plan to give back money from Nazis, Aryan Nations or KKK types or at least donate the money to a worthy group like the Salvation Army?<br />
Does Paul plan to condemn the activities of groups like the Nazis, Aryan Nations, and KKK?<br />
Since you are the go-to-guy on Paul has he ever made a statement like:</p>

<p>"Just to be explicit, I think racism in private matters is disgusting, and in government matters it is a violation of the principle of our equal, individual rights. I'm sure that the vast majority of Libertarians will agree with me on this issue...."</p>

<p>If so, can you or Benton post the statement?</p>

<b>22.</b> Hear, Hear, Carol, right on.  I can only dream that maybe Newt makes it on the ticket as a VP.</p>

<p>As it is, I'm quite concerned about our candidates come caucus time here.  I will be attending the caucus specifically to keep Ron Paul supporters from taking over.  When I take a look around and consider support for Huckabee, Rudy, and McCain, I might have to do something I said I would never do, vote for McCain.  If that is what it'll take at the county caucus to keep Paul from winning, I would - hopefully it doesn't come to that.  But with Romney's attack on McCain in NH, it sure makes me feel at least a tiny bit more fondly of that turncoat.</p>

<p>To be fair, I've put up everyone's recent ads so viewers have a chance to judge the content for themselves.  As to your point about "amnesty," I think the immigration debate has been so hashed and re-hashed that I hardly need to add commentary on that specific issue.</p>

<p>Lastly, Romney never "supported" any of McCain's immigration legislation.  The supposed sourcing for that is a November 2005 interview with the Boston Globe where Romney said some aspects of a proposal by Senator McCain and Senator Cornyn  were "reasonable."  You'll note that Senator Cornyn was opposed the actual immigration legislation that McCain tried to push this past year.  To construe Romney's comments on that bill two years ago into today's debate, let alone turning them into something they weren't, is a total misnomer.</p>

<p>I will address your donation questions since those are legit questions that have not been addressed ad naseum.  As for the racism questions, you or anyone else interested will have to look at previous replies regarding these strawman attacks.</p>

<p>The money is coming from not just a few groups as you are suggesting.  Paul has kept his financials more transparent than any other candidate by posting real time donation information.  His donations are coming from hundreds of thousands of individuals.  Yes a couple have been identified as coming from some racist organization.  </p>

<p>His support is not coming from the left by people you think really just want Hillary to Win.  Ron Paul would be a nightmare for Hillary.  He would tear her anti war agenda apart for what it really is leaving her with a few die hard hillarycare supporters left supporting her.  Any other GOP candidate will be easy for her to defeat because all she will have to do is say she is antiwar and she will have a good 55% plus of the population on her side with that statement alone.</p>

<b>26.</b> Regarding this issue of "welcoming new people to the GOP" or "turning away new people from the GOP."</p>

<p>Anyone who has walked precincts and doorbelled using lists of voters who are supposedly Republican or Republican-leaning knows that there are many "false positives" from non-Republicans who crossed over to vote in the 2000 Washington State GOP primary.</p>

<p>Of course, we know that John McCain, in 2000, for a while had a lot of "supporters" and supposedly "brought a lot of new people into the Republican Party" - or at least it seemed that way to some people at the time. </p>

<p>However, were those McCain supporters loyal to the Republican Party? How many of them voted for McCain in an effort to thwart Bush in the GOP primaries, fully intending to vote for Al Gore in the general elections?</p>

<p>How many of Ron Paul's supporters have any intention of loyalty to the Republican Party? Or will they vote for an antiwar Democrat or antiwar Libertarian in the general election? Ron Paul himself has not pledged to support the GOP nominee. He is a Republican congressman, but won't commit to loyally supporting the Republican nominee. Will his supporters really be loyal to the Republican Party?</p>

<p>Whether or not Ron Paul runs as a Libertarian, both the Democrats and the Libertarians will run antiwar candidates in the general election, while the Republicans will run a pro-victory, pro-national defense candidate in the general election.</p>

<p>The pro-victory Republican candidate will win the election, with their electoral triumph all the larger in proportion to the degree they also run on a platform of fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, and opposition to illegal immigration.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<b>28.</b> Some Democrats, some antiwar activists, some liberals, and some others have misinterpreted the real meaning of the 2006 elections.</p>

<p>During the 2006 election campaign, it was often pointed out that Democratic Party candidates would, if elected, seek to cut off funding for our troops, and try to enforce a timeline for retreat from Iraq.</p>

<p>Often, the response from many Democrats, many liberals, and many antiwar activists was something along these lines: "No, not at all! We're not against the troops! We won't cut off funds or force a precipitate withdrawal! That charge is a false accusation - just Republican hyperbole!"</p>

<p>Such denials became more and more common during the campaign, especially as November approached.</p>

<p>Despite their sincere lack of interest in a victory strategy, the Democrats knew that they could not win the elections if the voters thought that in power, they would cut off the funds and enforce a timeline for retreat.</p>

<p>That, by the way, says volumes about where the American people actually stand with regard to the war against terrorism, support of our troops, and the desire for success and victory in Iraq.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the November elections, the Democratic Party leaders started claiming a mandate for withdrawal timelines, defunding, "ending" the war, etc. Although this was not really the position of the American people, it was the sincere goal of the Democrats.</p>

<p>Turn to late 2007 and early 2008. In the early stages of the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, the leading (and even the non-leading) candidates tried to trump each other's antiwar credentials.</p>

<p>Especially since encouraging progress in the military situation and the backfiring of the ultraleft Moveon.org attack on General Petraeus, the Democrats (especially Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) have started to verbally distance themselves from timelines and funding cutoffs.</p>

<p>In fact, just as Kerry in 2004 at the Boston Demcoratic convention sought to portray himself as a military hero who would do a better job of fighting and killing the terrorists, we can expect the 2008 Democratic nominee to similarly claim they would not retreat, not surrender, not cut off funds, etc.</p>

<p>The Democrats have already begun to slightly distance themselves, and as November 2008 approaches, they will continue to incrementally distance themselves from the far left. The better to get elected, you see.</p>

<p>Some Democrats, some liberals, and some antiwar activists falsely claim that the 2006 elections represent a "mandate" to "end" the war. However, if it were really true that the American people agreed with retreat from Iraq, there would be no brake stopping the Democratic candidates from pursuing their misguided, but sincere, "exit strategy." (Besides, even retreat from Iraq would not "end" the Islamic fascist war against us.)</p>

<p>As in 2004, they will fail, I believe. But in order to make sure that their disingenuous effort fails, Republicans and convservatives and others who support victory must hold the Democrats' feet to the fire. We must constantly point out that the Democrats' sincere desire and sincere goal is to force retreat from Iraq, and to go back on the defensive with regard to the threat of Islamic terrorism.</p>

<p>I suppose your McCain Comments are valid.  My question would be though... how were they treated by the GOP when back in 2000?  Had they been treated better would they have been more loyal?  </p>

<p>As for Pauls campaign... you are right... I will have a hard time voting for a different GOP canidate if Paul does not get the nomination.  However President is but just one small part of the party.  Local political leaders should use these campaigns to bring in supporters, volunteers, and future leaders and candidates for all the local elections that affect the people much more.  Paul supporters on a local level want to reduce government power in olympia, bring school choice to everyone not just the rich, reduce/elliminate taxes, elliminate government monopolies such as the ferry system and liquor control board, etc... These are all things the local GOP leaders should be jumping head over heals to get supporters and PCOs for.  But instead some (not pudge) are screening them out all becuase of just one election.</p>

<p>The fact that he will not rule it out means he is not someone that will willy nilly make absolute claims that so many politicians make.  He made that clear in his meet the press interview that he has NO INTENTIONS of running other than as a republican.</p>

<p>As for him not being a republican, he has ran as one and won at least 10 times.  That should count for something.  I guess those in brazoria county TX GOP just do not know enough to listen to you when voting in those GOP primaries down there.  Nevermind all of his policies are pretty much the same as what Reagan and even Bush ran on.</p>

<p>As for him being power hungry... what has attracted many people to his campaign is in fact his aversion to power.  This is a man that has returned part of his congressional office budget each and every year.  A man that is relunctantly running for president only because people kept begging him to do so.  This is a man that wants to reduce the power of the presidency.  This hardly sounds like a power hungry man.  </p>

<b>34.</b> At comment #27 in this thread, Bruce states "and no, we are NOT loyal to the Republican Party."</p>

<p>Also, in <a href="http://soundpolitics.com/public/2007/12/ron_paul_vs_lincoln_and_reagan.html " target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a comment on another recent thread</a>, Bruce lists his presidential preferences in order of priority, as follows: "My preferences in the Prez.

<p>The fact that Bruce would vote for either Barack Obama or Dennis Kucinich over (for example) Fred Thompson only adds validity to his open proclamation regarding Ron Paul supporters that "we are NOT loyal to the Republican Party."</p>

<p>Whenever Bruce or other libertarians make the claim that the Ron Paul campaign is "bringing new people to the Republican Party" we should keep in mind this open proclamation.</p>

<p>Ron Paul, although a Republican congressman, refuses to pledge to back the Republican presidential nominee in 2008.  If he himself does not possess even this minimum level of support for the Republican Party, what level of true support can we expect from his followers?  </p>

<p>He will get roughly 1% of the popular vote and zero electoral votes, about the same result Cynthia McKinney (or somebody) will get for the Green Party.</p>

<p>Ron Paul and the Libertarian Party have no chance to be a significant factor in the 2008 presidential election.  His isolationist, non-interventionist views (for example on Venezuela and Cuba, see my comment #17 in this thread) are rejected overwhelmingly by the American people.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there was no issue at all, one way or the other, regarding bad treatment of cross-over McCain supporters in 2000.</p>

<p>In retrospect, however, it was mistaken and perhaps even naive to expect that these were "new forces" being brought into the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Even now, almost eight years later, the voter ID lists are often extremely unreliable, with numerous 2000 GOP primary McCain voters showing up as Republican or leaning Republican.  </p>

<p>As anyone who has done extensive doorbelling will tell you, very large numbers of these people are "false positives" - they were liberals and Democrats who deliberately voted for McCain in an effort to thwart Bush, fully intending to vote for Al Gore.  They often respond with hostility to Republican doorbellers.</p>

<p>What some antiwar activists, some liberals, some Democrats, and some others call "engaging our enemies" (whether Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, etc.) is absolutely in contradiction to the Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>During Reagan's first term as president (1981-1985), Congressman Paul opposed Reagan on many foreign policy issues, including Cuba, Nicaragua, Libya, and Grenada.</p>

<p>It is not a good idea (and it is not a Republican or conservative idea either) to treat enemies, dictators, and pro-terrorist regimes "with friendship" as we would treat anybody else.  Ron Paul's comments on Venezuela and Cuba (below) somewhat tend in that direction, don't they?</p>

<p>Also, it is not a correct analysis (and it is not a Republican or conservative analysis either) to say or imply that America is somewhat responsible for the creation of tyrants like Chavez or Castro.  Ron Paul's comments on Venezuela and Cuba (below) could inadvertently open some confusion on that score, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<p>I am sure we can all agree to reject the notion that America is in any way at all to be blamed for the creation of dictators like Castro and Chavez?  Surely nobody reading this thread would suggest otherwise, right?</p>

<p>RON PAUL AT 12/9/07 GOP DEBATE:<br />
"Well, [Hugo Chavez is] not the easiest person to deal with, but we should deal with everybody around the world the same way: with friendship and opportunity to talk and try to trade with people....  Actually, I believe we're at a time where we even ought to talk to Cuba and trade and travel to Cuba....  But ... let me tell you why we have a problem in South America and Central America: because we've been involved in their internal affairs for so long. We have been meddling in their business.  We create the Chavezes of the world, we create the Castros of the world by interfering and creating chaos in their countries...."</p>

<b>40.</b> Steve:  Here is a comparison that I think makes my point better than I have been able to so far.  </p>

<p>Think of a business owner that owns a store selling widgets.  </p>

<p>Some people come in to the store knowing they are going to buy something (these would be equivalent to current die hard republicans).  </p>

<p>Others come in looking for some new item they had heard about (equivalent to Paul supporters in 2008, or McCain in 2000).  Some of these new customers could end up liking what the see and become regular customers.  Others may be coming just for a special deal and never intend on coming back.  Others yet may come for the special deal, never intend to come back but still end up coming back as regular customers because they liked what they saw.</p>

<p><br />
Others come in to do some espionage to help the competitors store (equivalent to the 'false positives' you mention that were trying to help Gore in 2000).</p>

<p>Now as a shop keeper you have no idea which group is which so you have to either be nice to all or suspicious of all.  By being suspicious of all you are going to turn away all the people that came into your store with an open mind (Paul supporters).  This will hurt business which will make your store less attractive to your regular customers.</p>

<p>Or you could treat all customers good and in the end you end up with a better store, more customers and pretty much no loss.</p>

<p>So my point is sure you could treat all Paul supporters like they are evil hillary supporters.  The end result will be you hurt the GOP but at least you will have less false positives when you go doorbelling.  Eventually you only have a few doorbells to go to which will make doorbelling easier as well.</p>

<p>Or you could treat them like new customers, wow them, and you will end up with a bunch more republicans and a few more false positives.  </p>

<p>MArzolf seems to have chosen to reduce the number of doorbells in an effort to reduce false positives.  I woudl rather deal with the false positives and grow the party.</p>

<p>Historically, yes the GOP primary goal was protectionism and high tarriffs.  In the past 50 years however that has been more of a democrat stance than a republican stance.  America was built on the idea of freedom and free trade.  Telling americans we can not trade with entire nations is not a traditional american view.  It has also been highly ineffective at achieving the goals our previous presidents have hoped such embargos would help.</p>

<p>But again the point is free trade with ALL is not an isolationist position nor an unpopular opinion.  Trying to claim that it is both to marginalize Paul is disengenuise. (sp?)</p>

<p>You write: "I am curious when the idea of interventionism and nation building became a central platform of the GOP that we are not to question?"</p>

<p>Leaving aside for a moment the label you use to describe traditional conservative Republican foreign policy, who said you "are not to question" that foreign policy?</p>

<p>Nobody disputes the right of anyone to "question" or "disagree" with traditional Republican conservative foreign policy.  In fact, far from trying to stifle such questioning and disagreement, I have been highlighting it, drawing attention to it, and trying to argue persuasively against it.  </p>

<p>I recommend searching the internet for Reagan's speeches and writings on foreign affairs and military policy, as well as such documents as Republican Party platforms and the transcripts of the 1980 Reagan-Carter debates and the 1984 Reagan-Mondale debates.</p>

<p>Compare, for example, the sharp contrast in foreign policy between the 1980, 1984, and 1988 Republican Party platforms, and the 1980, 1984, and 1988 Libertarian Party platforms.</p>

<p>As a congressman during Reagan's first term, Ron Paul often criticized the Reagan foreign policy.  Eventually, in 1987 he quit the Republican Party and ran for president on the Libertarian ticket in 1988.</p>

<p>During his presidency, Reagan received much sharp criticism (mostly from the left and the Democrats) on such as issues as Cuba, Libya, Grenada, Nicaragua, and other foreign policy concerns.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many libertarians (including Ron Paul) sometimes joined the chorus of opposition to the Reagan foreign policy.  </p>

<p>Some libertarians, in their sharp opposition to the Reagan foreign policy, went so far as to use such words as "foolish," "tragic," "disgrace," and "flawed" in describing Reagan's foreign policy.  Other libertarians accused Reagan of pursuing a policy that was in the interests of "international bankers" and "industrialists."</p>

<p>I recall that some 1980s opponents (mostly leftists, liberals, and Democrats) of the Reagan administration even accused Reagan of picking a fight with Libya, and of provoking and defying Qaddafi.  Unfortuantely, some 1980s libertarians agreed with them.  It was in this context that Ron Paul left the GOP in 1987 and ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988.</p>

<p>Unfortuantely, Ron Paul has not substantially changed his foreign policy views since that time.</p>

<b>54.</b> Hey Travis,</p>

<p>Bush ran against nation building in 2000. Then on September 11, 2001, something happened that has never happened before in the history of this country. You might want to research it. It was really big and it changed everything.</p>

<p>Bruce, if you believe Paul isn't going to run in the general when he doesn't get the GOP nomination, I got a bridge and some swampland for you. A few months ago, he said he wouldn't. Now he says it's "unlikely". Do you get the subtle difference? He knows he can't win, so he's changing his tune. Ron Paul is a politician. Politicians say one thing and do another. Ron Paul is no different. He is just as power hungry as every other politician in Congress and everywhere else. If he wasn't power hungry, he  would have never run for Congress and he wouldn't be running for President now. Politics is always and only about power. </p>

<p>You cite the fact that he is running for his congressional seat as evidence he won't run, but remember Leiberman in 2000 when he ran for VP and the Senate in the same election? He covered his bases and there is no reason RP won't do the same.</p>

<p>You keep harping on his fundraising prowess. Big deal! Getting 200,000 people to give you $100 each is impressive, but won't win a national election.</p>

<p>I look forward to reading your posts after Ron Paul gets humiliated in the primaries and then runs as an L or I. Will you admit you were bamboozled?</p>

<b>56.</b> Michelle @53 : Good point.  How 'bout it, Steve, will you commit to endorsing Ron Paul if he wins the R nomination?  If you won't then you are taking the same attitude that you are unhappy about my having, and Ron Paul as well.</p>

<p>Deedub @ 54: Ron Paul has said that the odds are infinitessimal that he will run as an independent or Libertarian for president.  The only reason he will not say 100% "no" is that there is nothing certain in politics.  Something radical would have to change for him to run, and he is admitting that he can not predict this radical change.  But I believe him.  I have seen how hard it is to run a third party campaign, and I've seen how low the vote percentages one gets.  </p>

<p>And I am not happy that Ron Paul won't be running as a Libertarian.  I would love to be able to vote for Ron Paul as a Libertarian.  He's a far better candidate than any the LP has in the pipeline.  Sure, I'll admit that I was wrong if it happens.  But I really don't think it will.  I'll say the odds are less than 100 to one.</p>

<p>And there was discussion of attacking Iraq within the Bush cabinet BEFORE 9/11.  If this is the case, then what 9/11 changed was not the strategic defense reason for the attacks, but the political opportunity.  After all, we know there were no WMD in Iraq, and Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 or Osama bin Laden.</p>

<p>Here is another thing: 9/11 was not such a big change in the world's strategic conditions as you suggest above.  I recall getting an e-mail a while back listing all the Islamic terrorist attacks going back about two decades.  They included the bombing of the US barracks in Lebanon, the attack on the USS Cole, the first WTC bombing in the underground garage, the civilian jet that was destroyed over Lockerbie, Scotland, the cruise ship hijacking...  The point of all these was to lay the blame on other, mostly Democratic Presidents for ignoring the problem of Islamic terrorism, that had clearly been happening for decades.</p>

<p>Well, you can't have it both ways.  Either 9/11 represented a new strategic situation, or the situation was just the continuation of old conditions.  So, which was it?  I tend to think it was the latter, and that prior administrations' policies had a lot to do with allowing the 9/11 attacks to happen.</p>

<p>Don't you agree?</p>

<b>57.</b> And another thing. You Paulbearers (damn, that's funny!) keep talking about how this election will be won be an anti-war candidate. That's ridiculous! You keep talking about how this war is unpopular. Can you give me one example of a popular war in U.S. history? Of course not. There hasn't been one. If you say World War II was a popular war, you would be wrong. It was opposed by a lot of people who thought we shouldn't get involved. Fortunately, most of the country saw what was at stake and pitched in to win. Not because the war was popular but because they wanted to end it victoriously as soon as possible. Of course, if Ron Paul had been running things then, the Nazis would be running Europe now. </p>

<p>You guys are totally clueless about the meaning of the polls that show that people don't support this war. Nobody wants our troops over there. If a pollster asked me "Do you want our troops home from Iraq tomorrow?" I would say "Yes." But if that same pollster said "Should the United States of America accept defeat in Iraq so our troops can come home tomorrow?" my answer would be a resounding "Hell, no!!!" We did that once in Viet Nam and our country is still paying a heavy price for it. </p>

<p>Here's the thing. I'm somewhat ambivalent about whether we should have been in Viet Nam, but to leave on the terms that we did was shameful. We can disagree about whether we should be in Iraq (I believe we are doing the right thing there), but if you believe, as your candidate does, that the U.S. should accept defeat, then you are just as anti-American as he is.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, I'm going to take some abuse for that one. That's fine. It's like Bill Kristol pointed out the other day, Ron Paul opposes everything this country has done for the past 150 years. How can you get more anti-American than that?</p>

<b>61.</b> Bruce @ 56,</p>

<p>You have repeatedly stated that if defeated in the GOP primaries your guy would not run in the general. Now even you are hedging your bets. Kinda shows you are not as gullible as I thought and you hope your guy is as dishonest as I think he is. </p>

<p>As to your 9/11 comments, yes, they discussed attacking Iraq in Bush's cabinet meetings, as I'm sure they did in Clinton's. Both groups probably talked about war with China, too. What's your point? Making contingency plans is part of the job of the people who have sworn an oath to protect us. </p>

<p>Otherwise, I don't disagree with you much about 9/11 except I think you are missing an important point. What changed was not the danger that the world faced. What changed was the perception that the world was a dangerous place at all. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, we were lulled to sleep that the world was now a safe place and there were no more threats. Well, some of us. I listened to the radio the morning of 9/11 without surprise but with the horrible feeling in my gut that what I knew would eventually happen had finally happened. If perception is everything, then everything changed that day. </p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that I hold Reagan just as responsible for 9/11 as Clinton and Bush 41 just as much as Carter. I think the blame can go to every president as far back as Kennedy if you really want to analyse it, with the possible exception of Ford. (He wasn't in there long enough to do much damage.)</p>

<p>As far as having it both ways, I don't think so. It's not a new strategic situation. The Islamists had declared war on us much earlier and our leaders ignored them. But it wasn't a continuation of the old conditions either because we had a president that actually woke up to the fact that something meaningful had to be done. Without 9/11, I don't believe Bush would have understood it or done anything about it either. Whether you agree with what he's done or not, I don't see how you can deny that he is the first US president who has addressed the problem in any kind of realistic manner. Has he made mistakes? Yup. But he at least takes it seriously, unlike any of the Dems running or your guy.</p>

<b>62.</b> Deedub, then we are mostly in agreement on the issue that the only real thing that changed on 9/11 was the people's PERCEPTION of how dangerous the world actually was.  But above, @ 54 you said that 9/11 was really big, and it changed everything.  </p>

<p>That seems like a contradiction to me.  Care to clarify?</p>

<p>And I am not "hedging my bets."  I have always thought that the odds that Ron Paul would run for President as an independent or as a Libertarian were unfortunately, very low.  I still think that today, and that is exactly what Ron Paul has said over and over again.</p>

<p>I am not a betting man, but if I were I would bet that Ron Paul would not run as a non-R.  For me to hedge would be to also bet that he would do so, but I do not bet that way.</p>

<p>I'm not a betting man, so perhaps I misunderstand the term "hedging your bet". All I'm saying is that, like your candidate, you are softening your statment that he will not run if he loses the GOP nomination which he most certainly will.</p>

<p>As far as your question about 9/11, I stated earlier, if perception is everything (as I believe it is) then everything changed on 9/11. Unfortunately, reality doesn't really matter. Only peoples' perception of reality does. Do you understand that?</p>

<b>64.</b> Michelle @ 53:</p>

<p>I certainly do appreciate your support, my friend.  In response to your three questions:</p>

<p><em>Steve, you know I have great respect for you and have promoted your candidacy on Life of the Party. But I need to ask you about this statement [that Ron Paul refuses to pledge to back the Republican Presidential nominee]. 1) Do you think this justifies any county GOP to turn away Ron Paul supporters?</em></p>

<p><strong>No.  As I said in post #43, there is no reason to be mean or cruel to Ron Paul supporters, or to turn them away.  Ron Paul's campaign, and Ron Paul's policy proposals, should be discussed, debated, and judged on their merits (same as any other candidate).  I am merely pointing out, among other things, that Ron Paul's foreign policy is in stark contrast to Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt.  </strong></p>

<p><em>2) Why would you hold it against someone to not pledge backing of the GOP nominee, regardless of who it is? I know a huge constituency, a large portion of the pro-life movement, who refuse to back Giuliani if he gets the nomination. Should these people be excluded from becoming PCO's? </em></p>

<p><strong>No loyal and committed Republican Party activist should be excluded from becoming a Republican PCO, regardless of which Republican presidential candidate they support.  We should keep in mind the purpose of the Republican PCO.  They are the representative of the Republican Party in their neighborhood - advocating and doorbelling for Republican candidates and policies, publicizing Republican events, raising money for Republican candidates and Republican organizations, and helping increase Republican voter turnout so that Republican candidates are elected.  These activities are not for everyone, but anyone who is willing to put themselves forward and meet the responsibilities of a PCO, who meets the qualifications of a PCO and goes through the appropriate process to become a PCO should be welcomed.</strong></p>

<p>I respect the fact that some people, including some Republicans, may want to leave their options open for the general election.  Some may want to campaign actively for an independent, Libertarian, or even a Democratic candidate.  While I respect their right to do so (and in that sense I don't "hold it against them"), I disagree with them.  Also, people who want to keep their options open in this way should consider carefully whether they can faithfully serve as a Republican PCO.  Generally speaking, I'm in favor of giving people the benefit of the doubt, especially if they present themselves as loyal, committed Republicans and in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p><em>3) As strongly as you feel about the war, would you pledge right now to back Ron Paul if he is the nominee? </em></p>

<p><strong>I absolutely pledge right now that I will vote for the Republican presidential candidate in the November 2008 elections.  </strong></p>

<p>However, I fully expect Ron Paul to be on the ballot in November 2008, either as an independent or on the Libertarian ticket.  Also, Ron Paul himself refuses to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee.  Given this, it appears that this is the example and model he wishes his supporters to follow.  If Ron Paul himself does not possess even this minimum level of support for the Republican Party, what guidance is he providing his supporters with regard to the level of true support they should provide the Republican Party in the general election?</p>

<p>Whether or not Ron Paul runs as a Libertarian, both the Democrats and the Libertarians will run antiwar candidates in the general election, while the Republicans will run a pro-victory, pro-national defense candidate in the general election.</p>

<p>The pro-victory, pro-military Republican candidate will win the election, with their electoral triumph all the larger in proportion to the degree they also run on a platform of fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, and opposition to illegal immigration.</p>

<p>It is not just about the war against Islamic fascism, but overall foreign policy philosophy.  As I stated in posts #49 and #51, during the Reagan administration, Ron Paul was highly critical of the Reagan foreign policy, including on Grenada, Libya, Cuba, and Nicaragua.  Over his political career, Ron Paul's foreign policy has been sharply counterposed to the Republican and conservative foreign policy in the tradition of Reagan.</p>

<p>Defeating the Democratic candidate in 2008 (whether Obama, Clinton, Edwards, or somebody else) is important - we need to block their agenda of amnesty for illegal immigrants, government-run health care, tax increases, unrestricted abortion, and defeatism and weakness in the war against Islamic fascism.</p>

<b>65.</b> Bruce at #56:</p>

<p>You ask me: "Steve, will you commit to endorsing Ron Paul if he wins the R nomination?"</p>

<p>I absolutely pledge right now that I will vote for the Republican presidential candidate in the November 2008 elections.  However, I fully expect Ron Paul to be on the ballot in November 2008, either as an independent or on the Libertarian ticket. Also, Ron Paul himself refuses to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee. Given this, it appears that this is the example and model he wishes his supporters to follow.</p>

<p>You also write: "9/11 was not such a big change in the world's strategic conditions."</p>

<p>I don't think I am exaggerating much in saying that this comment generally reflects the position of Ron Paul and many of his supporters.  Of course (although from a different perspective perhaps) some Democrats, some far left activists, some liberals, and some antiwar activists have a similar approach to foreign policy in the post-9/11 era.</p>

<p>Such myopia, denial, and weakness on foreign policy is nothing new - during his presidency, Reagan received much of the same type of sharp criticism (mostly from the left and the Democrats) on such as issues as Cuba, Libya, Grenada, Nicaragua, and other foreign policy concerns.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many libertarians (including Ron Paul) sometimes joined the chorus of opposition to the Reagan foreign policy. </p>

<p>Some libertarians, in their sharp opposition to the Reagan foreign policy, went so far as to use such words as "foolish," "tragic," "disgrace," and "flawed" in describing Reagan's foreign policy. Other libertarians accused Reagan of pursuing a policy that was in the interests of "international bankers" and "industrialists."</p>

<p>I recall that some 1980s opponents (mostly leftists, liberals, and Democrats) of the Reagan administration even accused Reagan of picking a fight with Libya, and of provoking and defying Qaddafi. Unfortunately, some 1980s libertarians agreed with them. It was in this context that Ron Paul left the GOP in 1987 and ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ron Paul has not substantially changed his foreign policy views since that time.</p>

<b>67.</b> This debate has strayed from what is really important.  We can debate all day whether this policy or that is the 'true' policy of republicans.  We can both find examples to show either side of the policy is the 'true' one.</p>

<p>We have tried a little of both in the past hundred years.  The path Wilson and T.

The free trade path has led to the greatest economy in the world and closer ties with past enemies to the point where we consider them allies.</p>

Actually, it isn't an two option approach, there are at least four options in dealing with other countries: (1) Free Trade, (2) Restricted Trade (i.e., some Trade Restrictions), (3) No Trade, and (4) Intervention (which has two subcomponents of (a) limited intervention (Bosnia, etc.), or (b) occupied intervention (Iraq)).</p>

<p>You can't just say Free Trade is a way to go.  We may, as a foriegn policy stance, want to have options 2 or 3.  For example, I view China as falling in category (2) and Cuba as falling in category (3).  Are you stating from your liberaterian position that countries' policies do not matter and we should have free trade irregardless of the countries policies?  That position would seem to me to be a naive and dangerous course that puts morals and countries behaviors behind greed.  I would not wish to take this approach.</p>

No, I don't agree with Free Trade with Cuba, nor with China, and nor with countries that disregard human rights (e.g., Burma, etc.).  I also do not believe in Free Trade with countries that abuse trade policies with us (e.g., charge our goods tariffs, while we allow their goods in w/o tariffs).  You can only have Free Trade if both parties are willing to play by the rules, this includes human rights issues along with economic issues.</p>

Bush has explained this many, many times over the last 6+ years. Just because you refuse to hear it, doesn't mean it hasn't been explained.<br />
To put it as simply as possible:<br />
9/11 was done by (Islamic) terrorists. <br />
Terorists controlled Afghanistan, we had to take remove that threat.<br />
Sadam was an aggreassor in the Middle East, invading neighbors, developing WMDs (Yes,he did), and supporting terrorists (Yes, he did). We had to remove that threat.<br />
The next threat that comes along (probably Iran) will have to be dealt with too.</p>

<b>77.</b> To Katomar #68, especially,</p>

<p>I usually just read the posts, but I will chime in as number 4 or 5 for Ron Paul (using your numbers).  Y'all keep debating Paul's foreign policy/trade stance, but, though very important, it is more important what the future direction of this country will be domestically.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is the only candidate worth supporting, if you are concerned at all about getting any of your freedoms back.  Maybe you are too young to remember that America was a very free country in it's day (I can only remember to the 1970's, but what a difference!).  With the unconstitutional drug war, SWAT teams in every podunk town that break into houses and kill the wrong people, carrying of "your papers" everywhere you go, the IRS invading all the privacy you have left, "zero tolerance BS", etc. this country is starting to suck. </p>

<p>We have no where else to go!  (Poeple who love freedom that is).  It's not like we can go to any other country for more freedom, while the socialists can take their pick of dozens of countries with their brand of socialism (they never seem to leave though ??? huh?).</p>

<p>This is the last resort - there is no more land to the West to get away from the Bull.  It's time to take a stand, and if you don't want that stand to be very violent, we should try to do it in a political manner via Mr. Paul and decent libertarians and conservatives.</p>

<p>I'd vote Thompson next, but as a distant second to Mr. Paul.</p>

It would have been more acceptable, evidently, to have had peaceful free trade with a slave holding Confederacy. I wonder what words the same Paul supporters would use to describe slaveholders.

<p>The logic of Paul supporters escapes me. Are they 1960's flower child holdovers that believe all the world has to do is gather in a big circle,hold hands,chant and everything will be ok?  Or are they Pat Buchanan isolationists?  I think it's more likely that Paul has gathered around him a confused group of people that really aren't sure what they believe.  </p>

<b>83.</b> Katomar @ 68</p>

<p>You are absolutely right, the Paulzis have hijacked yet another thread.  I was looking forward to a discussion on the relative strengths of the real candidates, and instead we have another festival of Ron Paul thread crapping.</p>

<p>It's funny, one of the strongest argument the right has against the left is the left's tendency to make the assertion that all arguments, faiths, and points of view are equal.  They aren't. The Paulzi's embrace this concept.  In post 64 Steve Beren said:</p>

<p>"there is no reason to be mean or cruel to Ron Paul supporters, or to turn them away. Ron Paul's campaign, and Ron Paul's policy proposals, should be discussed, debated, and judged on their merits (same as any other candidate)."</p>

<p>Pile of dung.</p>

<p>All candidates are not equal. They don't deserve equal attention.  Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel are not serious players for the Dems.  Alan Keyes is not a serious player for the GOP.  Ron Paul is just another loon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately his geeky cadre of true believers think that disrupting discussions is an effective means of gaining converts.  That greatly devalues forums that allow them to dominate the discussion.  </p>

<p>If you want to discuss legalizing pot or prostitution, great find a serious person who supports it, not RP.  Pull out of Iraq?  The argument can be made, but RP is not the guy to do it.  He has been relegated to the status of sideshow freak because of his, well, clownish nature.</p>

<p>I'm a libertarian and a humanist.  I agree with RP on many of the issues.  But the way he phrases the arguments for them is not helpful.  His dancing around with the North American Union conspiracy nuts is just goofy.  What's next, 911 truthers?</p>

<p>This forum is just too big for people to ignore the RP trolls.  Bruce or travis spouts off, and somebody always takes the bait.  Don't argue with them point by point.  They are true believers.  Unfortunately with moderation that is too light and so many participants it is always just too easy for the RP brigade to suck up all the air out of too many discussions.</p>

<p>All that aside, I agree with Eric.  It's Iowa or nothing for Romney.  If he gets as much as second place, I think he's pretty dang close to done.  If Huckabee wins Iowa, he could get some much-needed undecideds in later states (Supah Tuesday, anyone?).  I don't think, however, that Huckabee has to, HAS to win Iowa to do well in later states, but it will do a lot to rejuvenate his base and win more caucus-goers later on.</p>

<b>87.</b> Cyndi @86: Actually since the threads topic is the GOP presidential primary race, talking about Ron Paul is not hijacking it.  And if you read the comments, it was his detractors that really were the ones that wanted to talk about Ron Paul instead of others.  I just wanted to point out that an analysis of the race without including the top money earner seems incomplete.  </p>

<p>I really think if a serious analysis of paul was put into the original post, there would be alot less reason for Paul supporters to have to mention him in the first place.</p>

<p>And as helpful advice, if you do not want a certain topic discussed, the best way to handle it is to discuss something different rather than discuss how you do not like the topic that is being discussed.  In otherwords talk about the other candidates if you want to hear others opinions about the other candidates!!!<br />

We could have done so as well, and we would have had less racism today if we had done so. If the south were independant, we would have strong trade ties with them today.

<b>116.</b> Bill,</p>

<p>I don't think your Jimmy Carter analogy works at all.  Paul does think America is half-way down the shitter (or whatever nice way you put it ;-}, but 2 things:</p>

<p>A) He's right, in how he sees the loss of our freedoms, not in Jimmy Carter's lack of confidence in the American people and the American way.</p>

<p>B) I think Mr. Paul's solution to return to the Constitution (hey, that rhymes, cool) is 180 deg. opposite from Jimmy's socialist idiotic ideas to fix things back in the late 1970's.</p>

<p>I personally don't believe we should get out of Iraq without finishing the job we started (suprise, huh?), but I don't think we had any business getting involved.  Yes, Saddam Hussein was an evil man and killed and tortured people, what else is new in the world (see N. Korea, the Sudan, pretty much most other countries in Africa, Tibet, etc?</p>

<p>American soldiers did not sign up to risk getting killed or maimed for some other country's population, only to defend Americans.  I understand neo-cons' "best defense is a good offense" idea, but I don't think it was the correct thing in Iraq.</p>

<p>Now, after telling you that, I think Ron Paul is the only candidate out there who understands what a free America is (really "used to be") about.  He means it!  No one else does.  That is what matters to me.</p>

<p>We need to stay out of the world's business unless in imminent danger, stop letting countries invade us via our southern border, and start reading the damn US Constitution and abiding by it.</p>

<p>And yes, SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE.  That is in reference to my reply to Katomar last night, when I told him I would reveal the nasty secret this year.  The way this country is headed, in 20-30 years, getting to eat died-green mushed-up former Americans will be a treat compared to the rest of life in the Police State of America coming.  ha.<br />

<p>What in Pauls 20 year history as a congressman leads you to beleive he would increase spending?  What has he said in his campaign that differs from his voting record in congress that would lead you to believe he would raise spending?</p>

<b>120.</b> Bill:</p>

<p>I have heard him mention it in many speeches.  Usually at the begining when he is so presently suprised to see so many young supporters out to hear about things like fiscal sound monetary policy and ending foriegn wars.</p>

<p>He gets very excited to see it.  He did not think the movement was as far along as it is.  He thought it would be another 20-30 years before so many would be so active and involved to return the federal government back to the size the constitution limits it to.</p>

<p>Dr Paul has never lost faith in america.  He just beleieves that its government has become too big.  Thankfully and surprisingly alot of people seem to agree.</p>

<b>123.</b> Travis,</p>

<p>You did not address Ragnar's issues.</p>

<p>1. So, Paul may vote against the final bill, but does he attach the earmarks to bills likely to pass? For example, a bill providing enhancements to military basis which he might vote against because of additional spending, yet it passes by a wide margin and he gets the earmark for his district.</p>

<p>2. You didn't address the harassment of bloggers and posters by Paul supporters which was also part of Ragnar's post. People are comparing notes and every blogger or poster that I am aware of who puts any information out about Paul is subject to vicious attacks and threats. So far, supporters of no other candidate have acted in such a manner.</p>

<p>3. On another thread, you lament the fact that the republican leadership doesn't feel that your committment is sufficient to be a PCO. As an observer of Paul tactics, his organization is parasitic and is looking for a host to advance "their" cause, not necessarily that of the host organization. This is what Duke and the KKK did with the republican party in Louisiana.</p>

<b>128.</b> I have to say it again Paulbearers really are intolerable. Earlier, I tried to say it in a way that would help you guys with your message but this time I am saying it because you guys are so pathetic.<br />
Also, anyone else notice the typical way a post is hijacked by Paulbearers? (Not this particular post though.)<br />
First, they make a decent point that sounds reasonable about the particular topic.<br />
"There is no way to trust that Hillary." (Or something similar."<br />
Then a couple of posts will go by and then they drop his name:<br />
"Well, no one else seems to be as right on this subject as...Our Lord and Saviour, the Almighty and The True God, Doctor Ron Paul, Blessed be His Name."<br />
Then the deluge begins. Post after post after post after post after post. I can only guess that Paul is taking all of the money he is raising and hiring people to troll all of the blogs and post away.<br />
Also, I refuse to believe Travis and Bruce and the other Paulbearers are conservatives, when you make statements like the war is unpopular and unwinable.<br />
And the subject of Paul voting against his own earmarks is as dishonest as it comes with politicians. He puts the hundreds of millions of dollars of pork for his district in the budgets bills, knowing full well his vote will not prevent it from being passed. Then, he gets to claim some moral high ground while still wallowing in the orgy of money being wasted. <br />
Paul is pathetic and so are most of his supporters.</p>

<p>I wonder about that too when they make statements that seem to come directly from the Democratic/Mainstream Media playbook.</p>

<p>Mighty interesting in general isn't it that the Iraq War has faded as an issue?  Nothing breeds press avoidance from the left like Republican success.</p>

<p>The left now obsesses about the economy instead.  Where is the same left that accused George W. Bush during the 2000 campaign of "talking down the economy"?  Liberals have been talking down the economy for the past 6-years, with the help of their press lackeys.</p>

<b>130.</b> The press has all but stopped talking about the "failed" war, but the Paulbearers still regurgitate that nonsense.<br />
Go to any place you can post comments, especially soundpolitics and look at the number of comments. You can tell which ones have been hijacked by Paulbearers. Most on this site have 10-20 posts, then look at the ones that have 100+ and see if Paul's name comes up.<br />
I almost want to go to a completely unrelated post on some site and then just post the name "Ron Paul" and see how fast the number of comments can triple.<br />
Regarding the economy, the left isn't just talking down the economy, they are blatantly trying to sabotage the economy with the constant doom and gloom. This inspite of the contstant good news about the economy. </p>

<p>I could not agree with you more, Thom. If the Dow is up 200 points AP News always has a "but the housing market is in free-fall" line to contradict it.  The leftist media lives for doom and gloom...until the libs are in power. Then we will see nothing but glowing reports about the economy. A least we conservatives see through this phony garbage.

<b>132.</b> WVH at 123:</p>

<p>I am sorry I did not completly address Ragnars comments.  That was not my intention.</p>

<p>1. Yes he adds amendments to get earmarks for his district for bills that easily pass.  He also fully discloses all earmarks he proposes.  This does not increase spending, and is not against his statement that he always votes again spending.  I must reiterate again... he always votes against all those bills he adds earmarks to.  I can see why people might think it is hypocrtical.  However I see it more as a service to constituents, returning to them their hard earned money that was taken in high taxes.  They should not be punished simply because they voted for a man that beleive in lower spending while the rest of america votes in big spenders.  It is certainly debateable as to whether it is right or not.  I kinda wish myself that he did not do it, but then again I do not live in his district.</p>

<p>2. First of all there is no coordinated comparison of notes.  It is just a bunch of supporters that like to read the news about Paul.  </p>

<p>second, yes there have been reports of threats.  They have been few.  There is really no way to verify that these are truly coming from Paul supporters or from some other person pretending to be.  But regardless of who they are coming from I think they are dispicable.  So does Paul and he has stated that often.  They are however not a reason not to vote for Dr Paul who has above all other canidates been honorable and respectful to all the other candidates, even while they openly laughed at him in debates!  Dr Paul makes it a policy to not attack other candidates and the one time when he did, when he mispoke about the Huckabee ad, he immediately apologized.</p>

<p>Beyond threats, yes Paul supporters are quick to respond to negative articles about paul in large numbers.  Being a Paul supporter myself, I can tell you it is not a coordinated thing. But I also see nothing wrong with writing to people and giving your opinion.  Do you?</p>

<p>3. The Paul movement shares nearly 100% of the state GOPs goals.  It would be a good movement to have as a parasite.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I should respond or not.  You seem to find me intolerable yet you also seem to want me to address comments you made.  I will address them this time but in the future if you find me intolerable please make it crystal clear that you do not want me to reply.  And sorry in advance if you did not want me to respond this time.</p>

<p>Anyways the one thing I wanted make certain you understood... Paul is by no means paying people to post on blogs.  It is actually the other way around... the people posting on blogs are paying a relunctant Paul to run for office.  </p>

<p>It is perhaps so amazing to be considered unbelievable, but Paul truly is an honest politician that wants government out of peoples lives.  This has attracted a LARGE grass roots movement, there is no need for him to pay people to post on blogs.  In fact his official campaign has paid for less supporters in Iowa and NH than people that have travelled there from across the country from tehir own money or moeny contributed by other supporters outside the campaign.  Paul also has not paid 1 penny to raise money, it has been done nearly all by unpaid volunteers.  Paul also has had unpaid volunteers outside the official campaign that has wrote letters to fellow citizens in NH and Iowa, called people in those states, raised money for a freakin blimp to fly the eastern seaboard advertising his name, even send DVDs to people.  All by individual citizens outside the campaign.  To suggest that he would need to pay people to post on blogs for him is ludicris when you consider how much more people have done on their own.</p>

<p>As for being a conservative... Bruce does not suggest he is.  He says he is an independant.  I think I am but if you think I am not because I believe the war is unwinnable... that is fine.  Conservative is just a word.  The thing that is important is we both want less government, not more, if we chose to call each other different things so be it.</p>

This to me is what embodies a conservative. </p>

<b>136.</b> Travis,</p>

<p>I have no objection to debate of issues. For most here, debate is a hobby. Like you, I am not a republican. Most here, who support a candidate, do so with a great deal of committment and spirit. Cyndey supports Huckabee and Eric supports Romney. I know that Huckabee and Romney have been mixing it up in Iowa. I have not read reports of either group of supporters threatening or sleazing the other group. That is not true of Paul supporters. Debate is good, threats and sleeze are not. Everyone knows how to use the Internet, so if you guys want to put out spam on steroids or flood voting sites, oh well. Not that it is going to stop the Paul critics. Just as you are in it for the long haul, so are we. </p>

<b>137.</b> Travis,<br />
I apologize for being snarky. By the sounds of it we share a lot of similar values. My first post about Paul supporters was really meant to try and be helpful. My later one was meant to insult, which is petty. The comment about paying the posters was a joke.<br />
I think most Paul supporters are probably decent people, but there is a hefty percentaget that are borderline wackos. I am sure each candidate has them, but I think it is undeniable that Paul has a much higher percentage. <br />
One reason I question the conservative label that Paul supporters claim they are, besides the far left stance on the war and his isolationist foreign policy, is that in Seattle there are probably 10-15 Republicans/conservatives total. Yet, thereare hundreds of Paul signs everywhere. (By the way, none of them have the word Republican on them anywhere). That is why I think a 3rd party Paul run would hurt Dems just as much as Reps.<br />
We all have our issues with the 2 major parties, but backing a 3rd party is political suicide. It makes your vote meaningless and it also hurts the person you are otherwise closest to politically and helps the person you are least in tune with. I say this as someone who with their first presidential vote, cast that vote for Perot and pretty much helped vote Clinton into office. To this day I haven't been able to wash that shame off. I will never forget that lesson.<br />
Plus, Ron Paul is just not the right guy. Maybe after this election cycle a few of you will snap out of it and look back and see that too. <br />
