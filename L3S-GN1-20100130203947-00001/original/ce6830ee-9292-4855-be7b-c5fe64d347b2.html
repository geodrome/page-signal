But senior Iraqi officials said Rice also warned Prime  Minister Nouri al-Maliki against losing a «golden  opportunity» during President Bush's final year in office  to bring Sunni Arabs into a unity government.<br />

</table> further warned al-Maliki and other  Iraqi leaders she met in Baghdad that the recent reduction  of violence in Iraq could prove fleeting if the country's  main Shiite, Sunni Arab and Kurdish groups did not reach an  enduring agreement on the future shape of Iraq.<br />
Underlining the continuing fragility of the security gains  made over the past six months, at least five mortars landed  late Tuesday in the U.S.-protected Green Zone, home to the  U.S. Embassy and the Iraqi government offices. There were  no immediate reports of casualties or damage to the heavily  fortified central Baghdad region where Rice held meetings  several hours earlier.<br />
Rice, who split off from U.S. President George W. Bush's  Mideast tour for an unannounced visit to Baghdad, said the  Iraqi parliament's approval Saturday of a U.S.-sought  benchmark law allowing low-ranking members of Saddam  Hussein's Baath party to reclaim government jobs or  pensions was a first step and showed that last year's  «surge» of American forces was paying dividends.<br />
«It is clearly a step forward for national reconciliation  _ a step forward for healing the wounds of the past, and it  will have to be followed up by implementation that is in  the same spirit of national reconciliation,» she told a  news conference after meeting al-Maliki.<br />
«I hope we will focus on what needs to be done, but also  on how much has been done,» said Rice, who flew to Baghdad  from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.<br />
Although national reconciliation «has not always moved as  fast as some of us sitting in Washington would like, it has  certainly moved and, given the legacy, history and stains  of tyranny, it has been quite remarkable,» she said.<br />
Three Iraqi officials said Rice told al-Maliki he must  take advantage of Bush's last year in the White House to  aggressively pursue national reconciliation, with the  return of Sunni Arabs ministers to his Cabinet as a top  priority.<br />
Bush has vigorously supported al-Maliki since the Iraqi  leader took office in May last year. Bush's Democratic  critics, however, have not been as supportive, with some  charging that al-Maliki lacked the leadership qualities  needed to make difficult decisions to reconcile Iraqis.<br />
The Iraqis officials spoke to The Associated Press on  condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to  share the information with the media. Two of the three  attended meetings Tuesday between Rice and Iraqi leaders.  The third was briefed by a senior participant.<br />
Rice's emphasis on national reconciliation comes at a time  when the embattled al-Maliki appears unable to hold  together a functioning government that represents all  Iraqis.<br />
Six Sunni Arab ministers quit al-Maliki's government in  August to protest his perceived sectarian policies. Kurds  remain in the government, but differences have emerged  between the two sides over a draft legislation to divvy up  Iraq's oil revenue and Kirkuk, the oil-rich city claimed by  the Kurds. The city's Arab and Turkomen inhabitants dispute  the Kurdish claim.<br />
Al-Maliki has balked at conditions set by the Sunni Arab  parliamentary bloc that pulled its ministers from his  Cabinet. He threatened to fill the vacant posts with  members of Sunni groups that rose against al-Qaida in Anbar  province and elsewhere in Iraq and joined U.S. and Iraqi  forces in the fight against the terror network.<br />
Al-Maliki, however, never carried out his threat and,  furthermore, antagonized many of the Sunni groups by  blocking their integration into the Shiite-dominated  security forces.<br />
«The Prime Minister told her that the air has been  cleared and that the Sunni ministers were expected to  return to the government in the near future,» one of the  three Iraqi officials said.<br />
The dispute between al-Maliki and the Sunni Arabs has been  characterized by public clashes between al-Maliki and Vice  President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab whose three-party  alliance in parliament _ the Iraqi Accordance Front _  pulled out its six ministers in August.<br />
The two met Monday for the first time in months after a  mediation by top politicians, including President Jalal  Talabani, a Kurd, Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a  Shiite, and Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the country's  largest Shiite party. Rice met all three Tuesday.<br />
«We see a desire by the government to meet our demands,»  said Salim Abdullah, a Sunni lawmaker and a spokesman for  the Accordance Front. «Monday's meeting narrowed  differences and created a climate of trust between  al-Hashemi and al-Maliki.<br />
<!--APIMG--><br>The return of the Sunnis to the government could go a long  way in restoring the leadership credentials of al-Maliki,  but should not be taken as the magic key to national  reconciliation.<br />
Leaders of the Sunni groups fighting alongside the U.S.  military against al-Qaida have made no secret of their  political ambitions with some claiming that they, rather  than traditional Sunni parties, are the true representative  of the Sunni Arab community.<br />
The de-Baathification law that Rice congratulated  al-Maliki on is one of 18 steps which Washington considers  benchmarks to promoting reconciliation.<br />
A senior aide to al-Maliki said Rice also encouraged the  prime minister to promote the progress of the other  benchmark legislation, including one regulating provincial  elections, constitutional amendments and legislation on the  equitable distribution of oil revenue.<br />
In northern Iraq on Tuesday, Turkish warplanes bombed  Kurdish rebel hideouts, the Turkish military announced, as  Turkey's deputy military commander made a surprise visit to  Baghdad to discuss cooperation in fighting the rebels.<br />
Gen. Ergin Saygun, the Turkish military's  second-in-command, met with Iraqi Lt. Gen. Nasier Abadi,  deputy chief of staff for the Iraqi army, as well as with  Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, the  military said in a separate statement.<br />
They discussed fighting Kurdish rebels and possible  military cooperation, the army said.<br />
It was a first visit to Iraq by a top Turkish commander  since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.<br />
Tuesday's Turkish air raid was the fourth on rebel  positions in northern Iraq since the military launched a  bombing campaign on Dec. 16. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip  Erdogan vowed on Monday to «finish» the rebels soon.<br />
The Turkish bombardment started at about 11:30 a.m. and  was still going on, said Zirar Mohammed, a top  administrative official in the Iraqi border town of  Sedakanil and Col. Hussein Tamir of the border forces in  the city of Dahuk. <!-- COM9_20080115185953632.txt --><br />
