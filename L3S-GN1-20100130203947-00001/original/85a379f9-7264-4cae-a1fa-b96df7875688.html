Also killed were an elderly man caught in a crossfire in northern Gaza and a 14-year-old Hamas supporter shot in the southern town of Khan Younis after he left a mosque, relatives said. <p>Late Tuesday, Israeli security released a statement saying two gunmen who killed two Israeli hikers in the West Bank on Friday were Fatah activists, a disclosure that could further complicate peace moves. Abbas is the local leader of Fatah. The statement said the two surrendered to Palestinian police to avoid arrest by Israel. <p>On Tuesday, however, Barak said the roadblocks have proven effective against Palestinian attacks. <p>Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Barak&#145;s comments were "very unfortunate." <p>Barak has ordered the removal of two dozen dirt embankments and two of the 16 major West Bank checkpoints since he became defense minister in June, but the Palestinians say that has not made a significant change. <p>Even Israel&#145;s closest international allies want it to pull back in the West Bank and share Jerusalem, Olmert said in an interview published Tuesday. <p>Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want those territories for an independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. <p> "What will be if we don&#145;t want to separate?" Olmert said. "Will we live eternally in a confused reality where 50 percent of the population or more are residents but not equal citizens who have the right to vote like us?" <p> About 5.4 million Jews live in Israel alongside 1.4 million Israeli Arabs. Another 3.9 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. <p> ___ <p> Associated Press Writer Ibrahim Barzak contributed to this report from Gaza City.                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font><br><!-- (c) 2003, 2005 PHPNews - http://newsphp.sourceforge.net/ -->
