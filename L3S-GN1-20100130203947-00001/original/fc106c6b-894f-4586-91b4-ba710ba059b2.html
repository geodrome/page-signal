<p class="hn-byline"><span class="hn-date">5 days ago</span></p>
<p>US president George Bush has predicted that a Middle East peace treaty will be completed by the time he leaves office.</p><p>He said he was convinced that both Israeli and Palestinian leaders understood "the importance of democratic states living side by side" in peace.</p><p>"I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will emerge," Mr Bush said.</p><p>"I am confident that the status quo is unacceptable, Mr. President," he told Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. "And we want to help you."</p><p>Mr Bush is on a three-day visit to Israel and the West Bank to show support for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks following seven years of violence.</p><p>Police sealed off large parts of the West Bank city of Ramallah ahead of Mr Bush's first visit as US president.</p><p>Mr Abbas received Mr Bush at his walled headquarters, which was repainted and had its helipad repaved before the meeting. Residents in buildings around Mr Abbas' compound were told to stay away from windows and balconies and Palestinian security officials said US snipers were being deployed in the area.</p><p>Mr Bush, who arrived in Israel on Wednesday, is spending much of Thursday in the West Bank, and will visit Jesus' traditional birthplace in Bethlehem.</p><p>He was to fly from Jerusalem to nearby Ramallah by helicopter, but Israeli police said heavy fog forced the president to make the journey by car instead. The 30-minute car trip took Mr Bush through two Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank.</p><p>Mr Bush's visit has generated little excitement among Palestinians, who are largely sceptical of his promises to try to move along Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The US is perceived in the Palestinian areas as a staunch ally of Israel, at the expense of the Palestinians.</p>
