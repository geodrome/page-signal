<div id="hn-content" class="g-secti8 in the latest battles in the district of Mannar.</p><p>The ministry placed its own losses at six soldiers wounded, but the Tigers said they killed at least 20 government soldiers and wounded another 40. The rebels placed their own losses at three guerrillas killed.</p><p>"The Sri Lanka armed forces fighting units are already beaten back in two of the three fronts," Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan said in a statement. </p><p>"Both sides use heavy artillery, multi-barrel rocket launchers and small mortars to provide tactical support fire to respective troops. The shelling duel and firefights still continue in those areas," the statement said.</p><p>Both sides regularly make sharply differing claims about casualties and independent verification is rarely possible. Journalists are not allowed into rebel-held areas in the north.</p><p>The state-run Sunday Observer reported that the military planned to "eliminate" the separatist Tamil Tigers in the next six months with stepped up military action in the new year.</p><p>"There are around 3,000 LTTE terrorists remaining and the military targets to annihilate them within the first six months of the next year," the newspaper quoted army chief Sarath Fonseka as saying.</p><p>Sri Lanka is pressing for a military victory over the rebels, fighting for a separate state for the ethnic Tamil minority in the Sinhalese-majority nation. Tens of thousands have died on both sides since the conflict erupted in 1972. </p><p>The latest casualty claims by the military bring the number of Tamil fighters killed since December 1 to at least 535, according to the defence ministry. This compares with less than 30 troops reported dead or missing by the military.</p>
