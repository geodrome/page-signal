<p>He's such a great cook and such a brilliant publicist, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that the two parts of his life are now blended into a slightly unnerving sauce which leaves you anxiously counting your hand whisks. Tonight on Channel 4, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/river-cottage/hughs-chicken-run/hugh-s-chicken-run-07-12-18_p_1.html">he sets out</a> to turn his home town of Axminster into the free-range chicken equivalent of the town down the road, <a href="http://www.plasticbagfree.com/">plastic-bag-free Modbury</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is a good thing. If you are going to eat meat, you owe it to the creature concerned as well as to your taste buds to make sure its life, short though it may be (39 days to rear a hen, in industrial conditions), is a happy one. That's happy in the sense of an absence of pain, rather than an attempt to anthromorphise a hen's experience of life. Happy hens are delightful creatures, keeping up a low, harmonious susurration of contentment when allowed to take their own route from slug to seed head to nesting box, or the bonnet of your car if it's warmer.</p>

<p>However, maintaining the national flock in such conditions, apart from exposing them and us to bird flu and the constant depredations of foxes, rats, badgers etc, would be very expensive and probably require most people to move to somewhere more spacious - Vietnam, say - where much of our cheap fowl flesh is reared in conditions far removed from those in which the bird originally evolved. (You will remember that south Vietnam was once known as Cochin China, and that there is a fine breed of hen still, the <a href="http://www.poultrymad.co.uk/chickens/cochin.html">Cochin</a>, distant ancestor of the battery bird.) </p>

<p>Hugh F-W's charm and determination may well conquer the good folk of Axminster, a reasonably prosperous small market town, very like Modbury in its make up. At least it will until the next time they're desperate for a curry after a night in the tavern, or a fried chicken for the family after an exhausting day out. Cracking the cheap bird, the "two for £5" offers in supermarkets, looks easy compared with taking the cheap bird out of the ready meals and takeaways and restaurants everywhere. </p>

<p>Saying that the task is insuperable is no reason for not starting out on it. But it is as well to be aware of the real costs of an hour-long TV programme. Victory in Axminster would give lift-off to the RSPCA's new campaign to outlaw industrial chicken rearing. Soon the government would respond with a ban. </p>

<p>But we've been here before, with another worthwhile project. Banning the hideous practice of rearing calves in crates so they could be sold as milk-reared veal was a triumph, which sadly led only to the export of the practice across the North Sea. The same thing happened with pig production: more than 70% of pork eaten in Britain is reared in conditions that would be illegal here. </p>

<p>Last week, the government released a fascinating analysis of <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/upload/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/food/food_analysis.pdf">our eating and spending habits (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>We're mostly eating healthier food, more fruit and veg and so on, and we import more and more of it - although the report does not trouble to explain that this is because cheap food is often less ethical food. As we grow richer, we're spending a smaller proportion of our income on what we eat while becoming more interested in its source - except the poorest two-fifths of the population, who still spend nearly 20% of their income on food and don't have the luxury of insisting on organic. The only answer that would allow them to keep eating chicken, and chicken that had lived a short but contented life, is to make them richer. Now there's a thought.  </p>

<p>Free range (animal welfare) and organic are not the same thing - please could they not be used interchangeably. </p>

<p>Free range is dearer than intensive farming, but organic is much dearer again. This kind of mistake makes me wonder if the author knows anything at all about the subject or is just rehashing other people's views.</p>

<p>Good food can be cheap if you buy your own ingredients, eat lots of cheap seasonal vegetables, use meat sparingly and use cheaper cuts. If you are really on the breadline animal welfare might make the difference but I suspect that 80% of those who buy intensive food could afford better welfare standards, if they wanted it aand could be bothered to look for it.</p>

<p>I'm no better. I do insist on free range eggs, but only rarely buy free range meat, and I could certainly afford to. Has it made me think again and will I make more of an effort - probably.</p>

<p>Very poor article,both confused and uninformative.Is there not a difference between organic,free range chickens and free range chickens?There seems to be in most supermarkets I've visited.Free range is good enough for me,as I suspect organic is a bit of a rip off inasmuch as it's only the feed which is organic,which can mean almost anything.</p>

<p>Good point about eating out though.I would think only a tiny minority of restaurants/takeaways use even free range meat.</p>

<p> I think the chicken farming issue is a right-and-wrong one, battery farms - at any rate of the kind I put in a day's casual work on, back in the 70s - being obviously, and very, wrong and horrible.</p>

<p>It would be right, IMO, to ban them first(and other set-ups that don't care properly for the birds, while maybe making plausible claims), and let the consequences work themselves out. If people out on the lash have to pay a couple of quid more for a chicken curry, so be it. The poor may have to eat less chicken, but with any luck it might be tastier and more nutritious when they do buy it - the cheap chicken is neither.</p>

<p>The issue of organic production seems to me fairly irrelevant to the question of whether to continue or to ban battery farming, which strikes me as a moral issue on its own - except insofar as happy farmyard hens find their own protein in the form of earthworms, one of several things they like or need that battery farming denies them.</p>

<p>Interesting to see the modern response to an ethical argument.</p>

<p>Some practical reasons, then: antibiotics, growth hormones, genetically modified feed, and heaven knows what else, go into factory feed to keep the animals alive until they can be killed. That ends up in your body. Antibiotics demonstrate evolution in action, giving a reproductive advantage to those organisms which are immune. That means antibiotic resistant bacteria, which is a special problem with beef, because of e. coli. Hormones aren't that healthy either, especially if you are male. As for genetically modified feed, it is sometimes grown with excessive pesticides, which the animal ingests.</p>

<p>Further, there is no comparison between the taste and texture of battery swill and free range organic. You don't need to eat organic filet mignon every day, you can get the same benefits from ground beef. And organic chicken is dirt cheap per serving.</p>

<p>Most of us would not suffer too much by decreasing our animal protein intake. Sum up what you spend on snacks and restaurants, and then think about putting that towards eating well at home. If you also like wine, as I do, then it is far, far cheaper to eat healthily, ethically, and well at home than to eat cruelly and badly in restaurants.</p>

<p>Anne Perkins writes "The same thing happened with pig production: more than 70% of pork eaten in Britain is reared in conditions that would be illegal here."</p>

<p>Simple answer - ban imports of all pork and other meats that do not meet UK welfare standards.  Oh No! we can't do that!  That would breach EU laws if the cruel practices are legal in, say, Holland (veal) or Denmark (pork) or if cruelly-reared Thai or Vietnamese chicken is imported to another EU country for processing before shipping to the UK.

<p>This article is trash. </p>

<p>First, it is predicated on an inflated view of the place of meat in our diet. I'd rather pay twice the price for all organic meats and have them half as often - they certainly taste more than twice as good as the factory farmed stuff.</p>

<p>Second, the issue of affordability is also much less simple than Ann Perkins suggests - the Food Standards Agency's most recent survey found that low income sectors smoke more and consume more alcohol. Cut the fags, drink less booze and buy organic meat.</p>

<p>Third, ethics aside, battery chickens taste horrible and are full of water and antibiotics. I don't see how anyone can recommend eating them. I'd like to see some data on how much meat is left on an organic and battery chicken after cooking - I bet the difference in price per kilo of cooked meat is much less than raw.</p>

<p>In contrast to this, the FN organization, FAO regards the Industrial Livestock Production as a health risk, including the battery chickens.</p>

<p><br />
"Industrial systems are characterized by large numbers of animals of similar genotype being raised, predominantly in confinement, for one purpose with rapid population turnover at a single site. This paper provides evidence suggesting that without commensurate private and public investments in bioexclusion and biocontainment measures these industrial systems can result in increased animal and public health risks."</p>

<p>In fact it IS the large industrial plants, that have been most exposed to bird flu, also in Europe.</p>

<p>"Large(r) industrial-type flocks appear to be overrepresented in the list of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported to OIE vis-à-vis outbreaks in backyard / village flocks in relation to their respective shares of total national flocks. Around 40 percent of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry reported to OIE between late 2005 and early 2007 occurred in poultry units of 10,000 birds or more (more than 25 percent occurred in units of more than 10,000 birds), while, even in many OECD countries, e.g. Germany, France, UK and Belgium, less than 10 percent of flocks consist of more than 10,000 birds.

But the poor, they need those coal fired power stations for affordable energy, or do you want the poor to freeze and starve to death?

<p>First off, the argument that we shouldn't try to improve animal welfare because Johnny Foreigner will still be beastly is a poor one.  As in all such campaigns, you have to start somewhere, and there's a reasonable argument that once you've put your house in order you're in a stronger position when urging others to do the same.</p>

<p>Secondly, so what if better welfare standards made chicken more expensive?  People don't need to eat meat, and they certainly don't need to eat it on a daily basis.  (One of the reasons I gave up eating meat was simple poverty) And surely making the vile fast foods that are the main place that battery chickens end up more expensive would actually be a positive in terms of overall health?</p>

<p>Oh, and I agree with those who find the author's inability to distinguish between organic and free range irritating.</p>

<p>Firstly I'm a carnivore definately not a vegetarian.<br />
Secondly it is quite clear to me that the era of cheap nasty and unethically produced meat is coming to an end for any number of reasons and rightly so. And I'm glad. I've reduced my meat intake and feel better for it. <br />
Thirdly there is no excuse other than selfishness to continue to eat meat that is both poorer in taste and nutrients and produced by dodgy methods.<br />
Fourthly: The so called working class (they don't and they aren't) can afford all manner of luxuries their ancestors could only dream of so its not a matter of them being on the breadline.</p>

<p>I thought it bad, but the comment that seemed to imply there is no point legislating about animal welfare because it will just lead to imports was infuriating. If you disagree with something you disagree with it. </p>

<p>There is potentially an issue of the trade off between animal welfare and human food supplies. If humans started caring more about animal welfare they would become vegetarians, and there would be a lot more land for human food growth rather than animal food.</p>

<p>Personally I don't afford animals very many rights and if it's much cheaper to factory farm so be it. I think part of the problem is that many people in this country have never killed the animals they eat and most meat is now served up looking very unanimal like so when a campaign like this comes along it's very easy to manipulate people. Most people don't think about the fact they are eating dead animals when eating meat so when you put a face to it people get over emotional.    </p>

<p>Well I just watched the program and it was excellent.  Really excellent.  It's a great campaign and HFW (I'm not sure which is worse, writing his name out in full or abreviating it) quite clearly starts off with his main problem firmly in mind - i.e. that people will say poor people cannot afford to give up intensively farmed meat.  I think he has started to tackle this admirably and I look forward to watching the rest of the series.  It's certainly made me more determined not to buy intensively farmed chicken.  Currently I'm in that broad category of people who shop well meaningly most of the time, but too often let things slide with a tempting special offer or a few beers a visit to the kebab shop.</p>

<p>You can argue that he's annoying, smug and priviledged (the last one clearly gets a lot of people's backs up), but you can't ignore the fact that he is right.  Absolutely right.  The conditions intensively farmed chickens are kept is totally disgusting, but what is more insidious is the way that it is hidden from the buying public.  If you are to eat meat you should face up to the realities of what that involves, all power to people like HFW who are working to expose people, for their own good in my opinion, to these realities.</p>

<p>I'm a bastard - if it tastes good I'll eat it. Bacon always seems to have flavour even if it reduces as a result of all that water. Battery chickens do NOT taste good so I always pay more for better quality. I am not throwing money around - I eat meat only when it is good. I make good stuff go a long way; I eat vegetarian (with meat stocks) when I can't afford the good stuff. </p>

<p>It can be expensive - I paid 75 euros for a 4 kilo turkey here in France as the Christmas piece de resistance. It was good but not THAT good. Yet any journalist's article which stops people buying the 2 for a fiver option is a good one in my view. A low income is not a good excuse for buying crap chicken - there are loads of healthier - and tastier - options.</p>

<p>Here is the only dish I ever invented - never seen it in a recipe book - and it only came about as a result of using up what was in the fridge....</p>

<p>Boil water, add pasta; while that is boiling, chop a couple of fresh tomatoes, throw the chunks into a bowl, add a good splash of olive oil, crumble some goats' cheese into the bowl, cut some ham (parma or any preserved ham) into strips, throw in some fresh basil, salt and pepper, mix with the drained pasta. </p>

<p>OK this is the luxury of being in south of France where such things are bound to be in the cupboard and fridge but... it is easy and cheap anywhere. It works. Who needs battery chickens?</p>

<p>British people are paying historically low percentages of their income on food.  There is no way they cannot afford to eat better.  The problem is that for so long the focus of the government and the farmers has been producing more at lower prices - because of World War Two, the Club of Rome, and Third World poverty.  But that is not a sensible model for the North any more.  We need Fish&Ag to take note and encourage farmers to produce more high quality food.  The model we ought to follow is French cheese making, not American cheese making.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is a simpler one.  Modern chickens cannot survive on their own.  Turkeys are even worse.  Everything loves to eat them from rats to foxes to hawks.  They have almost no ability to look after themselves any more.  Chicks have to be kept warm and protected - which usually means inside.  Unlike pigs, where there is no justification for intensive rearing, there is half a good reason for chickens.  How else do you keep the harriers off them?</p>

<p>Even so, free range chicken is not only a moral option, is a food quality option.  It tastes better.  Stevejones123, I am surprised that in your village in Lanka we call organic chicken 'bubble-gum chicken' because it's so tough.  OK, organic is a meaningless label that indicates nothing.  So does free range actually.  But Kampung Chicken is chicken that is raised, as the name suggests, free range in villages in the countryside.  It sells at a premium.</p>

<p>As for bird 'flu it is likely it is detected more often in intensive farms because they test for it more often.  The conditions in such places are ideal for the spread of flu between birds, but less so for the spread to people.  'Flu exists because in China people live with their pigs and chickens still in rural areas.  The germs live in the pigs and birds, and occasionally jump to people.  If you lock the chickens up in a big shed and allow no one to see them except wearing hazmat suits, there is going to be little spread to the wider world.</p>

<p>Which is not a reason to do it.</p>

<p>And if I could correct a little facoid - Vietnam is marginally more density populated than the UK.  About 255 people to the square kilometre.  Britain is about 246.  But then a large part of Vietnam is mountainous regions inhabited by minorities.  Where they do not raise chicken intensively.  So actually Vietnam is vastly more densely populated in those parts that are densely populated.  So moving there would not be moving somewhere more spacious.</p>

<p>On chickens - </p>

<p>In the 1970s 'New Scientist' had a  cartoon strip  about a mythical government research establishment "Grimbledon Down".  The boffins were tackling the food crisis: developing something called Nu-food, an edible substance, produced  directly from crude oil or raw sewage, on an industrial scale. </p>

<p>In the strip, the boffins working on Nu-food would bring  the latest batch to their boss Dr Treem, to taste-test. The Nu-food usually looked like mush, but Treem usually said it was not bad, and would ask the boffins, how they got the new taste or texture. The 'breakthrough' usually turned out to involve some awful new  ingredients or disgusting process - upon hearing which, Treem would choke and vomit. Back to the drawing board!  </p>

<p>The 70's cartoon was right on some things: food in future, would be manufactured not grown, and  on large industrial scale.  They imagined us using bacteria to produce Nu-food. They never guessed we'd actually use  -- chickens!</p>
