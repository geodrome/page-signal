That suggested the tape was made before the assassination. <p>"We intend to liberate Palestine, the whole of Palestine from the (Jordan) river to the sea," he said, threatening "blood for blood, destruction for destruction." <p>In Iraq, a number of Sunni Arab tribes in western Anbar province have formed a coalition fighting al-Qaida-linked insurgents that U.S. officials credit for deeply reducing violence in the province. The U.S. military has been working to form similar "Awakening Councils" in other areas of Iraq. <p>White House spokesman Tony Fratto said bin Laden&#145;s tape shows that al-Qaida&#145;s aim is to block democracy and freedom for all Iraqis. <p>Several hours before the tape was issued, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, said al-Qaida was becoming increasingly fearful of losing the support of Sunni Arabs and had begun targeting the leaders of the Awakening Councils. <p>"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al-Qaida, he said. <p>"The most evil of the traitors are those who trade away their religion for the sake of their mortal life," bin Laden said. <p>"Our duty is to foil these dangerous schemes, which try to prevent the establishment of an Islamic state in Iraq, which would be a wall of resistance against American schemes to divide Iraq," he said. <p> Bin Laden said Sunnis should pledge their allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the little known "emir" or leader of the Islamic State of Iraq. U.S. officials have claimed that al-Baghdadi does not exist, saying al-Qaida created the name to give its coalition the illusion of an Iraqi leadership. <p> "Failure to give allegiance to the emir after he has been endorsed leads to great evils," bin Laden warned. "Emir Abu Omar would rather have his neck severed than betray the Muslims ... Emir Abu Omar and his brothers are not one of those who accept compromise or meeting the enemy halfway." <p> The authenticity of the tape could not be independently confirmed. But the voice resembled that of bin Laden. The tape was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida&#145;s media arm, Al-Sahab, issues the group&#145;s messages. <p> The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing any tapes. The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years. The other messages this year have been audiotapes. <p> In an October tape, bin Laden sought to patch up splits between Iraqi insurgent factions, urging them to unite with the Islamic State of Iraq &#151; the insurgent coalition led by al-Qaida. He took a conciliatory stance, chiding even al-Qaida&#145;s followers for being too "extremist" in their positions toward other insurgents. <p> Bin Laden&#145;s deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec. 16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti-Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone cooperating with the Americans.                                                   	 		 					 	                     		                    <p>                                                                  By SALAH NASRAWI, Associated Press Writer                                                                 1 hour,  32 minutes ago                                                  		                          <!-- end storyhdr -->                          <p>                         CAIRO, Egypt - Osama bin Laden warned Iraq&#145;s Sunni Arabs against fighting al-Qaida and vowed to expand the terror group&#145;s holy war to Israel in a new audiotape Saturday, threatening "blood for blood, destruction for destruction."                                                  <p>The tape did not mention Pakistan or the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, though Pakistan&#145;s government has blamed al-Qaida and the Taliban for her death on Thursday.
