Col. Chakkrote Nongmanee. <p>More than 30 people, many of them civilians, have been decapitated during the insurgency. The object appears to be to terrorize Buddhists into leaving the region. <p>The region was a sultanate until it was annexed by Thailand in the early 1900s, and most of its Muslim residents are ethnic Malays who have more in common with the people of neighboring Malaysia. <p>                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font><br><!-- (c) 2003, 2005 PHPNews - http://newsphp.sourceforge.net/ -->
