    <div class=title>For the first time in a decade, former winner Jim McGovern back on tour</div>

    <div class=body><p>By DOUG FERGUSON</p>
<p>
AP Golf Writer</p>
<p>
HONOLULU (AP) -- The PGA Tour has 22 rookies at the Sony Open. That doesn't include Jim McGovern.</p>
<p>
He only feels like one.</p>
<p>
McGovern is a 42-year-old father of four who first joined the PGA Tour when some of these rookies were still in diapers and wondered if he would ever make it back to place like Waialae Country Club, the first full-field event of the year.</p>
<p>
Asked how long it had been since he had full status on the PGA Tour, McGovern rubbed the bottom of his goatee for a few seconds before his eyes brightened and he couldn't contain a smile.</p>
<p>
"Today,'' he said. "It's a second life that a lot of people don't get.''</p>
<p>
McGovern returns to full status for the first time in 10 years when he tees off Thursday in the Sony Open, the first full-field event of the year that is rife with optimism, not to mention introductions. The first few weeks are when veteran players spend most of their time glancing at the names on bags of players they don't know.</p>
<p>
McGovern is a blast from the past.</p>
<p>
In his third full year on tour, he beat John Huston in a playoff at the rain-shortened Shell Houston Open. That turned out to be a lone highlight in a career that soon became a grind as McGovern tried to balance expectations in golf with a growing family.</p>
<p>
For the last 10 years, he has been grinding away on the Nationwide Tour, trying to make do with what starts he could as a past champion, sweating over the final two stages of Q-school and wondering whether he should get a real job.</p>
<p>
A second life? You could say that.</p>
<p>
"The first time around I was living the dream,'' he said. "Now I'm working the dream. I've put in a lot of time and effort. The biggest thing is my wife instilling confidence in me. And I've swallowed so much pride that I've probably put on 25 pounds.''</p>
<p>
McGovern tied for 19th at Q-school, and few people were happier.</p>
<p>
He called each of his five brothers, breaking down in tears with every phone call. He flew home Tuesday from Florida to see his parents, and while is father is coping with Alzheimer's Disease, he was aware of what was at stake.</p>
<p>
"We were hugging, kissing and crying, and he said, 'When do we go? You were awesome! When's your first tournament?''' McGovern said. "It's been a great trip. It's been a trip. It's been a strange trip.''</p>
<p>
What went wrong?</p>
<p>
McGovern wouldn't change a thing except the results. After finishing 27th on the money list in 1993 and playing in his only Tour Championship, he found himself competing as much for others than himself. Then came the first of four children, and motivation to practice became harder when four smiling faces were staring at him as he walked in the door.</p>
<p>
The low point came a couple of years ago, when he started to consider working as a club pro. Then his wife would watch him play, tell him she liked what she saw, and McGovern kept plugging away.</p>
<p>
"That made this so much sweeter in the end,'' he said.</p>
<p>
McGovern spent December celebrating and staring at the calendar, knowing the Sony Open would be his first start, eager to see where this second chance on the PGA Tour will lead.</p>
<p>
But then, most everyone feels that way at Waialae.</p>
<p>
The field includes everyone from 17-year-old Tadd Fujikawa to 51-year-old Fred Funk, some players concerned about keeping their cards, others hopeful of winning to get into the Masters.</p>
<p>
The 22 players who were at Kapalua must feel claustrophobic this week. No other consecutive weeks on tour feature such a contrast, from the wide, sloping fairways on contoured greens of Kapalua to the tight, tree-lined fairways of Waialae with small, flat greens. One course was about power, the other about accuracy. And every tournament is ultimately about putting.</p>
<p>
The defending champion is Paul Goydos, who won last year for the first time in nearly 11 years.</p>
<p>
Goydos believes he's a better player than he was a year ago, and has felt that way since he first joined the PGA Tour. But he compared that with corporate fiscal performances, and realizes that sometimes getting better isn't good enough.</p>
<p>
"Everyone is getting better,'' Goydos said. "If you're 5 percent better, then yes, you are a better player. But against your peers, you're back a little bit. We're getting younger players, better players. If you don't improve by a reasonable amount, you're falling backward.''</p>
<p>
McGovern can relate. But he's too busy walking on air to be going anywhere at the moment.</p>
