<p>KABUL (AFP) &#x2014; At least six people were killed and six others injured in a Taliban militant attack on the main luxury hotel in Kabul on Monday while the Norwegian foreign minister was inside, officials said.</p><p>Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere was unharmed in the attack -- which included a suicide blast -- and took shelter with other guests in the basement afterwards, hotel and Norwegian officials said.</p><p>The US State Department confirmed a US citizen was among the dead but would not confirm the victim's name, sex or if they were civilian or military personnel, until next of kin had been informed.</p><p>A Norwegian journalist also died hours after being injured in the attack on the heavily barricaded Kabul Serena hotel which is popular with foreigners, several of whom live there.</p><p>Dagbladet newspaper correspondent Carsten Thomassen, 39, died during surgery at a NATO hospital near Kabul airport, the daily said in its online edition.</p><p>It was unclear if Thomassen was included in the death toll which Afghan interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary said hours earlier stood at six.</p><p>The Taliban leading an insurgency in Afghanistan said its men, including a suicide bomber, carried out the attack, which came as foreign minister Stoere was preparing for a dinner meeting.</p><p>"Four members of the Taliban, one of them wearing a suicide vest and all armed with Kalashnikovs, entered the Serena hotel and opened fire on foreigners," spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed told AFP.</p><p>"One of them exploded himself," he said.</p><p>NATO's International Security Assistance Force, which has 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, said hotel guards had shot dead one of the attackers but it was unclear what had happened to any others.</p><p>A Western security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said foreign soldiers had entered every room to search for any remaining attackers.</p><p>"First there was a suicide attack at the entrance of the hotel followed by a second explosion ... Then there was gunfire," he said.</p><p>He was not able to say if the second blast was also a suicide bombing, or if the gunfire came from guards or the militants.</p><p>UN chief Ban Ki-moon suggested the attack may have targeted the foreign minister, and it highlighted the need for action against extremist violence.</p><p>"I feel fortunate that he (Stoere) was not injured, but that really confirms that we must take necessary measures to address" terrorism," the secretary general told reporters at the United Nations.</p><p>"I am very much surprised by this terrorist attack against the foreign minister of Norway," he said.</p><p>Six people were wounded in the attack, the interior ministry's Bashary said, while the Norweigan foreign ministry said two of its nationals, a photographer and a diplomat, had been injured.</p><p>WAM, the United Arab Emirates' official news agency, reported what it called a reliable source within the UAE's foreign ministry saying an official from its embassy in Kabul had been injured.</p><p>The Serena said separately that two guests and two staff, both security guards, were killed. Two other guests and two employees were seriously wounded, it said in a statement that expressed "shock and outrage."</p><p>The Serena hotel, opened in November 2005, is the main venue for top-level functions of the government, foreign embassies and businesses in the capital.</p><p>It is heavily barricaded and reinforced because of security threats, with the Taliban-led insurgency at its peak in the country.</p><p>The Taliban were in government between 1996 and 2001, when they were removed in a US-led invasion launched weeks after the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda, which was sheltered by the Taliban regime.</p><p>The Taliban have since been waging an insurgency. Most attacks have been focussed on the southern and eastern areas bordering Pakistan, but spread across the country last year -- the deadliest 12 months in the insurgency.</p><p>Pakistan is also plagued by extremist violence -- the five-star Marriott Hotel in its capital Islamabad was targetted by a suicide attack a year ago that killed a security guard who prevented him from entering.</p>
