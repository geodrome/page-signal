					<h3>Cassio and Cornthwaite return for Glory clash</h3>

						<p>Adelaide United FC defenders Cassio and Robert Cornthwaite will be available this Sunday Night to tackle Perth Glory at Members Equity Stadium in Round 20 of the Hyundai A-League.</p>
<p>The key defenders both missed the loss to the Newcastle Jets through suspension, Cassio accumulating his fourth yellow card and Cornthwaite being shown a straight red in Round 18 against Sydney FC.</p>
<p>One stands at 195cm and the other just 168cm, but both have been an important part of United&rsquo;s defensive set up this season. Having only missed four games between them prior to the Newcastle game, the duo&rsquo;s absence was a considerable loss for The Reds, who despite their best efforts, could not prevent the Jets from finding the back of the net twice.</p>
<p>Cassio has proved to be United&rsquo;s prize signing this season, holding his own at left back (a position United struggled with last season), while providing a constant threat with attacking runs into the attacking third of the field.</p>
<p>Cornthwaite has had his most consistent season since signing with the club in 2005. In the games he has played this season, except for the send off against Sydney FC, the lanky defender has played every minute in the heart of United&rsquo;s defence, growing in stature and maturity, which was rewarded when he was selected in the training squad for the Under 23&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Reds have been guilty of conceding a number of soft goals this season and Cornthwaite and Cassio will be eager to ensure The Reds keep any chance of featuring in the finals alive and finishing off the season on a high by keeping the ever improving Perth Glory scoreless on Sunday. By keeping Perth scoreless on Sunday, United would manage only their third clean sheet this season.</p>
<p>Adelaide United still has the faintest of chances of making the finals, the permutation simple with The Reds needing to win their last two matches and hoping the Newcastle Jets falter.</p>
<p>The final two rounds sees The Reds face Perth Glory away followed by Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh Stadium while Newcastle lines up in a local derby away to the Central Coast Mariners before hosting the Glory at EnergyAustralia Stadium, with a win for Newcastle in either game enough to see them into the finals.</p>
<p>If United defeat Perth and Newcastle fail to beat the Mariners, there is the possibility that it could come down to the last round, The Reds hosting Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh Stadium in the season&rsquo;s final minor round game, with the Jets at home to Perth.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether United take the points against Perth on Sunday, if Newcastle defeat the Mariners a night earlier The Reds can kiss their finals hopes good-bye. All United fans will be crossing their fingers.</p>					</p>
