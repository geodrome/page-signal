It was clear the freewheeling Fischer &#151; U.S. champion since 14, grand master since 15 &#151; was the most serious threat to their dominance. <p>Fischer&#145;s confidence rose as he vanquished a succession of world-class players with trademark attacks that employed offensive tactics to crush opponents, not just simply defeat them. <p>London financier Jim Slater stepped in, matching the $125,000 put up by the organizers in Iceland, who also gave the players a share of the money from television and movie rights. The winner would get more than $231,000, the loser more than $168,000. <p>But there were more problems. Fischer complained about the lighting, the room temperature, the size of the chess board and the size of the table. Compromises were reached between the players on the lights and temperatures, the mahogany table was shortened, and the board was redone four times. <p>Retired Associated Press correspondent Andrew Torchia, who covered the Reykjavik match for the AP, recalled the difficulty in dealing with Fischer&#145;s demeanor when the young chessmaster was asked questions by reporters at the tournament. <p>The match was front-page news around the world. Chess was watched in bars across the United States. <p>The American then complained about the TV cameras being too close to the players. For the second game, he refused to leave his hotel room. <p> With Fischer now trailing 2-0, Spassky agreed to concede to the American&#145;s demand that they play the third game in a back room away from cameras. Fischer won the game, his first ever victory against Spassky. <p> Fischer followed with more wins &#151; in the fifth, sixth, eighth and 10th games &#151; and never fell behind Spassky again. <p> In the last game, Spassky was losing and under increasing pressure from Fischer. With his pawns under attack, Spassky resigned after his 41st move. Fischer was world champion, winning 12 1/2 points to 8 1/2 points, in 21 games. <p> "Chess is war on a board," Fischer once said. "The object is to crush the other man&#145;s mind." <p> Spassky was graceful in defeat &#151; too graceful for many back in Moscow, who criticized his performance and for failing to cope with Fischer&#145;s arrogance. Spassky eventually became a French citizen. <p> Reached at his home Friday in France, Spassky said he was "very sorry" to hear of Fischer&#145;s death. <p> Fischer lost his world title in 1975 after refusing to defend it against Anatoly Karpov. He dropped out of competitive chess and largely out of view, spending time in Hungary and the Philippines and emerging occasionally to make outrageous and anti-Semitic comments. <p> He praised the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, saying "I want to see the U.S. wiped out," and described Jews as "thieving, lying bastards." Fischer&#145;s mother was Jewish. <p> An unofficial rematch with Spassky was staged in 1992 in Yugoslavia. Fischer again complained about playing conditions, and again won. But the game was in violation of U.S. economic sanctions imposed to punish Slobodan Milosevic, then leader of Yugoslavia. <p> In July 2004, Fischer was arrested at Japan&#145;s Narita airport for traveling on a revoked U.S. passport. He was threatened with extradition to the United States to face charges of violating the U.S. sanctions. <p> Fischer renounced his U.S. citizenship and spent nine months in custody before the dispute was resolved when Iceland &#151; a chess-mad nation of 300,000 &#151; granted him citizenship. He moved there with his longtime companion, the Japanese chess player Miyoko Watai, who survives him. <p> "(Fischer) was an exceptional figure, who made his mark not only on the history of chess but on the history of the world," said French chess commentator Jerome Maufras. "For some, he was a genius. For others, he was a crazy man." <p> ___ <p> Brian Church reported from London. Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Jamey Keaton in Paris contributed to this report.                                                   	 		 <br><br> </font><br><!-- (c) 2003, 2005 PHPNews - http://newsphp.sourceforge.net/ -->
