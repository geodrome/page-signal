<h1>
<span class="x-nc-sel1">NHL roundup: Sunday's action on the ice</span>
</h1>
<p class="hn-byline">
<span class="hn-date">
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Dec 30, 2007</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Montreal Canadiens let one get away Sunday night - but the loss did little to spoil another successful road trip.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Brendan Shanahan scored 66 seconds into overtime to give the Rangers a 4-3 comeback victory over the Canadiens on Sunday night, extending New York's winning streak to three games.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Despite the loss, Montreal returns home having gone 3-1-2 on a six-game road trip interrupted by the league's Christmas break.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We got eight points out of 12, so we're happy with that," said Canadiens netminder Cristobal Huet. "Of course, you want all 12, but we're satisfied with how it turned out overall."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Canadiens, who improved to 13-6-3 away from home, return to the Molson Centre for a three-game homestand before embarking on a four-game trip.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Shanahan was sprung on a breakaway by Chris Drury. He skated straight down on Huet and sent a 15-foot wrist shot over the goalie's left shoulder 1:06 into the extra period.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"There was a turnover at the blue-line, and I moved up," Shanahan said. "I thought it was going to be a two-on-one, but I didn't see anyone between me and the net. Drury just laid it over for me, and I walked into it. I felt (Montreal defenceman Roman) Hamrlik coming up from behind, and I tried to get it away quickly. Overtime goals are always fun and exciting."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Huet said he had an idea what Shanahan was going to do, but not when he was going to do it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I knew where he would go with the shot," Huet said. "My problem was I thought he would wait another second before he let it go. He got it off quick, and it got past me."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Drury tied the game with 5:51 left in regulation when he found a loose puck at the top of the crease and flipped it over a prone Huet.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I didn't see the shot, but I saw it go at the net," Drury said. "I think the whole game felt like a playoff game, how the crowd was during the anthems and all. It was exciting."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Dan Girardi, who assisted on Shanahan's goal, and Jaromir Jagr also scored for the Rangers, who got 18 saves from Henrik Lundqvist.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Elsewhere in the NHL on Sunday, it was: Vancouver 2 Anaheim 1; Philadelphia 1 Florida 0; and Los Angeles 3 Chicago 2 (OT).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">At New York, Andrei Kostitsyn scored two power-play goals for Montreal, and linemate Tomas Plekanec also scored. Huet wound up with 17 saves.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We are disappointed that we lost a point," Montreal coach Guy Carbonneau said. "We were there right to the end. We had chances to put it away when it was 3-2, and we couldn't do it. It was a lot of young guys against an experienced team. I thought we played probably one of our best games this year."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Girardi put the Rangers up 1-0 just past the halfway point of the first period. Open at the right point, he took Scott Gomez's pass and beat Huet with a screened wrist shot. Girardi's seventh goal of the season came at 10:14.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Gomez extended his point-scoring streak to a dozen games with the assist.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Kostitsyn tied the game at 18:03 on a power play wrist shot from the high slot that beat Lundqvist over his glove hand, but the Rangers went back in front 17 seconds later when Jagr took Gomez's pass off a rush and sent a wrist shot from the low slot past Huet.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">In the second period, Montreal had a chance to tie the game at the end of a power play, but Christopher Higgins' wrist shot hit the right post.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Canadiens tied the game at 14:31 with Kostitsyn finishing off a tic-tac-toe passing play in front with a short blast past Lundqvist on a power play. Montreal took its first lead at 17:07 when Plekanec scored on a one-timer from the right circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Canucks 2 Ducks 1</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">At Vancouver, Daniel Sedin and Matt Cooke each scored and Roberto Luongo stopped 21 shots as the Canucks beat struggling Anaheim.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Flyers 1 Panthers 0</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">At Sunrise, Fla., Antero Niittymaki stopped 38 shots and light-scoring defenceman Derian Hatcher provided the game's lone goal as Philadelphia shaded the Panthers.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Kings 3 Blackhawks 2 (OT)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">At Chicago, Dustin Brown ignited a third-period comeback and added the overtime game winner as Los Angeles rallied to beat the Blackhawks.</span>
