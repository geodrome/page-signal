<h1>
<span class="x-nc-sel1">Kenya opposition wins speaker vote</span>
</h1>
<p class="hn-byline">
<span class="hn-date">
<span class="x-nc-sel3">14 hours ago</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Kenya's parliament narrowly elected the opposition party's choice as its speaker, underlining how difficult it will be for the president to govern after an election his rivals say he stole sparked deadly violence across the country.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Kenneth Marende, a 52-year-old lawyer, received 105 votes, to 101 for the president's candidate, Francis ole Kaparo, who had held the post until parliament was dissolved last year.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">While the opposition had the most seats in parliament, neither party held the two-thirds majority needed to elect the speaker in a first round vote, meaning both had to court legislators from minority parties during the first parliament session since the December 27 general election. Marende was elected on the third vote.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Rival politicians had clashed bitterly in parliament. Soldiers were deployed around the building, and some roads in the area were blocked off. Riot police were stationed along nearby thoroughfares.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The session was the first time President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga were in the same room since Odinga accused Kibaki of rigging the election.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Odinga has rejected an invitation from Kibaki for direct talks to resolve the dispute, and mediation efforts have stalled.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A week of violence after the vote killed at least 612 people and displaced hundreds of thousands, a government commission said. The crisis has severely affected the country's billion-dollar tourist industry, emptying hotels and weakening the shilling.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Before Tuesday's session began, both sides stood and applauded when Odinga walked in. But Odinga and his supporters remained seated and withheld applause as Kibaki arrived.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Odinga's party spokesman, Ahmed Hashi, had said attending the parliament session convened by the president "does not mean recognising the presidency of Kibaki".</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Meanwhile, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected in Nairobi on a mediation mission, but the visit was postponed several days after Annan fell ill with "severe flu," his office in Geneva said, adding he would head to Nairobi "as soon as feasible."</span>
