<span class="x-nc-sel2">DHAKA (AFP) ? A special tribunal in emergency-ruled Bangladesh has adjourned a corruption case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed until next week, lawyers said Thursday.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The next hearing has been fixed for January 21 to give Sheikh Hasina, leader of the major Awami League party, time to hold discussions with her lawyers, said prosecutor Sharfuddin Mukul.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"The court has allowed Hasina to meet her lawyers on Saturday and Sunday," he said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Last week, a metropolitan sessions judge in Dhaka said police evidence put before the court was grounds to continue the trial and formally indict her on corruption charges. Sheikh Hasina will be tried by a special fast-track tribunal set up by the military-backed government as part of its anti-graft drive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Officials said that under the country's penal code, she faced a maximum 14 years in jail if convicted. The trial would be concluded within the next two months, as required under the country's emergency rules.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Sheikh Hasina, who led the country from 1996-2001, has pleaded not guilty to extorting 435,000 dollars from a business group during her premiership.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">She is one of around 150 high-profile figures who have been arrested as part of the emergency government's corruption crackdown.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Her rival Khaleda Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who was prime minister until October 2006, is also in custody facing graft charges.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Emergency rule was imposed on January 11, 2007, after months of turmoil over vote-rigging allegations.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Polls planned for later that month were cancelled and the interim government took over the following day pledging to clean up Bangladeshi politics before holding fresh elections late this year.</span>
