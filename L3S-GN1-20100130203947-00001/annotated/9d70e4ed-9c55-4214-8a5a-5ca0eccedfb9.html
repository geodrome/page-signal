<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">ROME (AFP) ? Any doubts about whether or not former three-time world player of the year Ronaldo can still be a force in football were dispelled in just over 45 minutes on Sunday.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">That was the time it took for Ronaldo to score twice and set up a third as AC Milan finally managed to secure their first home league win of the season.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">After five draws, two defeats and a paltry three goals during the first half of the season, Napoli were the unfortunate victims as Milan scorched to a 5-2 victory.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It wasn't just about Ronaldo, though, as the European champions' new Brazilian attacking triumverate 'Ka-Pa-Ro' (Kaka, Pato and Ronaldo) combined for four of the five goals.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Fans have been talking about Milan's 21st century equivalent to their famous 1950s Swedish 'Gre-No-Li' partnership (Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm), and they didn't disappoint.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But it was the form of Ronaldo that most delighted Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">He latched onto an Andrea Pirlo pass to score the first goal, twice teed up Pato before Clarence Seedorf scored the second and then headed home a sumptuous cross from Seedorf 30 seconds after the break to notch the match-winner.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We were fantastic, particularly Ronaldo," gushed Ancelotti.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"He is a phenomenon and he proved it even though he wasn't in great shape.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Ronaldo started training on January 2 after six months of injuries. I'm happy for him, he's suffered a lot."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Ancelotti thrust Pato straight into the starting line-up for his debut and restored Ronaldo despite the striker - once unkindly nicknamed 'El Gordo' ('Fatty') during his time at Real Madrid - playing only 45 minutes of a friendly since his only other appearance of the season in late November.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We took a risky attacking approach but it was vital as we need to claw back points," added the coach, alluding to Milan's 12th place in the league and 25-point deficit to leaders and bitter city rivals Inter Milan.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">He was also delighted with Pato's contribution. The 18-year-old looked to be struggling a little before the break, missing two one-on-one chances in quick succession at one point.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But he grew as the game went on and took his chance with aplomb.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Pato? He's got great ability. It was his first game, there's certain things to improve on but he proved he is very, very good."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Pato was delighted with how his first game went but he still deferred to his hero and strike partner.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"The team played really well," he said. "I want to dedicate my goal to my family and my girlfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Ronaldo is the true phenomenon, not me. I'm really happy to have scored. How many more can I get? I'll go to bed and have a think about that and talk about it another time."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Ronaldo may have won the plaudits from his own team but visiting coach Edy Reja was most impressed by Pato.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I thought he would show his inexperience but instead he showed great maturity and mental strength," said Reja.</span>
