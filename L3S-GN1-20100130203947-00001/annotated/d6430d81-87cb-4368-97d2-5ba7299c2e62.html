<span class="x-nc-sel1">France to boycott Syria over Lebanon crisis</span>
</h1>
<p class="hn-byline">
<span class="hn-date">
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Dec 30, 2007</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">CAIRO (AFP) ? France will have no more contact with Syria until Damascus shows willingness to let Lebanon end its long-running political crisis and find a new president, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Sunday.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">France "will have no more contact with Syria... until we have proof of Syrian willingness to let Lebanon appoint a president by consensus," Sarkozy told journalists after talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak covering thorny regional issues.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The French president was on his first official trip to the Middle East since taking office in May and his Cairo talks followed a private Egyptian holiday with his new girlfriend ex-model Carla Bruni and a swarm of paparazzi.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Former colonial power France "wants a president for Lebanon," Sarkozy said. "It's time to provide proof (of goodwill), it's time for Syria to show it."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Keen to stress a continuation of his predecessor Jacques Chirac's Arab-friendly policies, Sarkozy called on Israel to make gestures to show its commitment to peace with the Palestinians.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I've said several times... that it's time for Israel to make gestures which would show that peace is possible, including ending settlements," in the occupied West Bank, Sarkozy said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Our position (toward Israel) is unchanging, being a friend doesn't mean being complacent," Sarkozy said,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Sarkozy has ruffled Arab feathers by showing friendship for Israel and rejecting anti-Americanism, with sections of the Egyptian press deriding him as President George W. Bush's new poodle, replacing British ex-premier Tony Blair.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">While the US remains Israel's key ally, France is seen by many as the Western power most able to end Lebanon's political impasse.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"It's time for Syria to prove with facts what it has not stopped saying in speeches," Sarkozy said. "We are now waiting for acts on Syria's part and not speeches."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Only last month, Sarkozy called Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reopening top-level contacts after a three-year break in a bid to end Lebanon's political crisis, Syrian media reported at the time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Mubarak described the political deadlock in Lebanon as "dangerous" and appealed to Syria to "use its influence in Lebanon to work towards reconciliation so that the parliament elects a president".</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Syria pulled its troops out of Lebanon in 2005 after a nearly 30-year presence in the face of strong international and domestic pressure but continues to be accused of meddling in Lebanese affairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Lebanon has been without a president since November 23 when Syrian-backed incumbent Emile Lahoud ended his term with rival parties unable to agree on a successor.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A parliamentary vote to elect a president has been postponed 11 times amid sharp divisions between the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora and the opposition, backed by Syria and Iran.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A Lebanese pro-government MP hailed the new tougher line from Paris.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"These comments express the disillusionment of the Arab world and the international community about the chances of agreeing anything positive with the Syrian regime," said Wael Bou Faour.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Earlier this month, US President George W. Bush also ruled out direct talks with the Syrian leader, saying: "My patience ran out on President Assad a long time ago."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">On Sunday, Sarkozy also said France would free up funds for a planned international tribunal intended to try those behind a series of assassinations in Lebanon that began with the murder of former premier Rafiq Hariri in 2005.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">UN investigators probing Hariri's murder have identified several people who they say may have been involved in the slaying, but no one has been charged.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Many in Lebanon blame Syria for the attacks, charges denied by Damascus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The French president refused to take any questions about the political furore at home about his use of a billionaire businessman friend's private jet for his Christmas holiday with his new girlfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">French opposition parties have accused the president of compromising his office and asked what plastics-to-media magnate Vincent Bollore can expect in return for his generosity.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But Sarkozy insisted that he had "nothing" to say on the controversy before his return to Paris.</span>
