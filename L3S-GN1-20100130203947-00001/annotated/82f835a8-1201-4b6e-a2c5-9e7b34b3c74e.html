Grant admires never-say-die Chelsea
</span></h2>

<p><span class="x-nc-sel3">
Chelsea manager Avram Grant watches his team during the Carling Cup semi-final first leg against Everton at Stamford Bridge in London, January 8. Chelsea won 2-1.
</span></p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Avram Grant believes Chelsea's never-say-die spirit will help his side reach a third League Cup final in four seasons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The London club snatched a dramatic 2-1 win over Everton in Tuesday's semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge despite being down to 10 men for most of the second half.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Shaun Wright-Phillips had given Chelsea the lead but after John Obi Mikel was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Phil Neville, Everton hit back to equalise through Ayegbeni Yakubu.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">David Moyes' team piled on the pressure but Chelsea refused to budge and mounted a late assault which culminated in Joleon Lescott's stoppage time own goal.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was a defiant display that proved there is no shortage of desire in the Chelsea dressing room.</span>
</p>
<div class="pictureCaption" style="float: right; width: 165px;">

</a>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Chelsea's Shaun Wright-Phillips (C) gestures after scoring the opening goal against Everton during the Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge in London. Wright-Phillips was 10-man Chelsea's star as they beat Premier League rivals Everton 2-1 in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The League Cup holders will travel to Goodison Park for the second leg on January 23 confident they can avoid defeat and move closer to retaining the trophy.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"With the small squad and all the problems - the injuries and the red card - the players deserve credit for the way they played," Grant said. "They showed spirit and character. I'm proud of them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We want everybody with us but we showed what we can do. You need to do that when you miss players. You have to pay attention to the small details.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"It's not easy at Goodison Park but it's not easy against us either. We have the advantage although it does not guarantee anything.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"If we play like this 11 against 11 we have a good chance."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Grant hopes to sign Bolton striker Nicolas Anelka before the return leg.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Blues had a 10 million pounds bid for the France international turned down last week, but he hinted they are set to go back with an improved offer.</span>
</p>
<div class="pictureCaption" style="float: left; width: 158px;">

</a>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Chelsea's Florent Malouda (R) clashes with Everton's Phil Jagielka during their Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge in London. Joleon Lescott's stoppage time own goal gave 10-man Chelsea a dramatic 2-1 win.</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We have confirmed we have an interest in Anelka. We made a bid two days ago because we wanted him for the Everton match but I hope it will be for Saturday," Grant said. "If not we will carry on with the players we have.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We do not plan to stay with one striker. It is important to do it quickly but this is not my area. I am not negotiating with Bolton."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">With Frank Lampard, John Terry, Andriy Shevchenko and Petr Cech all injured and Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, Salomon Kalou and Mikel away for a month on African Nations Cup duty, Grant's squad is stretched to breaking point.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So he will be relieved to see Wright-Phillips impress in a variety of roles in front of new England coach Fabio Capello.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"Shaun is in good form," Grant said. "I think he will be in the next England squad. He started in midfield, then on the right wing and then as a striker. He got used to it very quickly and that showed he is an intelligent player."</span>

</a>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Everton's Lee Carsley (R) jumps over his teammate Phil Neville to head the ball against Chelsea during the Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge in London. Joleon Lescott's stoppage time own goal gave 10-man Chelsea a dramatic 2-1 win.</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Wright-Phillips underlined his England credentials when he collected Florent Malouda's pass and curled a superb shot in off the far post.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Joe Cole and Claudio Pizarro wasted chances to put Chelsea further ahead and it almost came back to haunt them when referee Peter Walton sent off Mikel in the 54th minute.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Nigeria midfielder's fourth red card in 18 months sent Chelsea into disarray for a while and Yakubu punished them with a fine finish after James McFadden's free-kick was turned back into the area.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">When Chelsea's winner came it was cruel on the visitors. Deep into stoppage time Michael Ballack hooked over a cross and Lescott, under pressure from Wright-Phillips headed into his own net.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Chelsea's Michael Ballack controls the ball during the Carling Cup semi-final first leg against Everton at Stamford Bridge in London. Joleon Lescott's stoppage time own goal gave 10-man Chelsea a dramatic 2-1 win.</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Everton boss Moyes was caught between disappointment at a squandered opportunity and admiration for the way his side matched Chelsea in the second half.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"We know we will have the advantage of the crowd behind us but basically we are still playing a really good team. That's the problem. We will have to play really well to go through," Moyes said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I've been waiting for games like this at Goodison since I arrived; a cup semi-final second leg. I'd rather be drawing or winning but we're not out of it yet."</span>
