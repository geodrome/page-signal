<td>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Washington on Tuesday warned Iran against making threatening maneuvers towards American ships after a tense weekend standoff in the Strait of Hormuz, while Tehran denied anything other than "routine" interaction between the fleets.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">As US President George W. Bush prepared to depart for a week-long Middle East trip partly designed to seek a united front against Tehran, his spokeswoman blasted Iran's alleged menacing moves toward a American destroyer and two US frigates.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"It was out of the ordinary, it was reckless," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. "Our position is they should not do it again," she said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">For its part, Iran on Tuesday repudiated charges that patrol boats attached to its Revolutionary Guard had threatened to blow up American ships in the Strait of Hormuz.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"What happened between the Guards and foreign vessels was an ordinary identification," Ali Reza Tangsiri, commander of the Guards' naval forces in the region, told the Mehr news agency.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">He added that the Guards' naval forces had a right to monitor and identify "any vessel entering Persian Gulf waters" to the northwest.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">State television quoted an unnamed Guards source in the region as saying that "no threatening message was transmitted" in Sunday's incident.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">US defense officials said five speedboats from the naval forces of Iran's Revolutionary Guards menaced the three US warships in the strategic waterway on Sunday, radioing a threat to blow them up.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A US military official had quoted the Iranian radio transmission as saying: "I'm coming at you and you will blow up in a couple of minutes."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Crew aboard two of the five speedboats also dumped floating boxes into the path of one of the vessels during the encounter, but it passed them without any shots being fired, US officials said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"It was provocative, and that kind of provocation is dangerous. I would sincerely hope that the Iranians would refrain from any such activity," Rice told the BBC's Arabic service in an interview.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the incident as "provocative" and "dangerous," amid fears such an isolated encounter could spark a major confrontation between the two foes.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Iran is "the single greatest threat to the kind of Middle East we all want to see," she added in an interview to the Jerusalem Post and the Ynet website.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But Iranian officials expressed bewilderment over the US version of events, saying the encounter was a routine question of identification that ended with nothing special to report.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The incident came just days ahead of Bush's departure on Tuesday for a crucial trip to the Middle East, a visit that Iran has already slammed as unnecessary meddling in the region</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Bush aims to boost the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but will also reiterate to US allies in the region that Washington continues to view Iran as a threat.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Iranian media and analysts, expressing suspicion over the US version of events, described it as a propaganda stunt to tarnish Iran ahead of Bush's talks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"This action is routine and it is quite normal for ships to ask other ships to identify themselves. But because of Bush's visit to the region the incident took on a particular scale," said conservative analyst Amir Mohebian.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Strait of Hormuz is a vital conduit for energy supplies, with about 20-25 percent of the world's crude oil supplies passing through from Gulf oil producers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was Iranian Revolutionary Guards who in March last year seized 15 British sailors and marines in Gulf waters and held them at a secret location before releasing them in Tehran two weeks later.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"The biggest danger is that things snowball as a result of a calculation error, for example if the Iranians complacently think that the other side will not dare react to their provocations," said one Western diplomat in Tehran.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic links since 1980 when the United States cut relations amid a siege of the US embassy in Tehran by Islamist students that lasted 444 days.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Exchanges since then have been marked by acrimony and suspicion, with Washington accusing Tehran of interfering in Iraq, human rights abuses and defying the world with its nuclear program.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A recent US intelligence report that said Iran halted a nuclear weapons programme in 2003 has momentarily taken the heat out of the atomic crisis, but Washington still wants a fresh package of UN Security Council sanctions against Tehran.</span>
