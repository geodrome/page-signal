<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) ? Novak Djokovic gives a different kind of impression on the court.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Most players have been asked for their impression of the new, blue Plexicushion courts at Melbourne Park.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">After Djokovic beat Benjamin Becker 6-0, 6-2, 7-6 (5) Tuesday in his first-round match at the Australian Open, the television commentator implored Djokovic to do one of his impressions of another player ? specifically Maria Sharapova ? that have generated huge attention on YouTube.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">At first, he resisted ? "I don't want to offend anybody," he said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">But he soon gave in and did a reasonable imitation, right down to the Russian player's tendency to brush strands of her long blonde hair back over her ears as she prepares to serve.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The crowd gave him a standing ovation, and Djokovic later assured a news conference that Sharapova "doesn't mind" the impersonations.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"She's OK with it," he said.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Third-ranked Djokovic raced through the first set in just 22 minutes, generating sympathy for underdog Becker, who couldn't seem to find anything that worked and won only three points on his serve.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">About the only pain that Djokovic suffered early was self-inflicted. He had to call for the trainer after the fifth game to treat a small cut on his left knee from hitting himself with his racket.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Becker, looking increasingly disconsolate and frustrated, got a loud ovation when he held to win his first game. But Djokovic ran off the last four games of the second set.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The third set turned into a struggle.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"I lost my momentum," Djokovic said. "I almost lost that third set, then who knows what would happen?"</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Becker broke for the first and only time in the first game at love on a rash of Djokovic errors. Djokovic leveled the set at 2-all when Becker double-faulted on break point.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Becker won the first three points of the tiebreaker. He got an ace on a challenge of a line call to make it 5-5, but sent two forehands wide to finish the match.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The loss continued a stretch of five consecutive first-round exits at Grand Slams for Becker since his upset over Andre Agassi in the fourth round at the 2006 U.S. Open ? the last match of Agassi's career.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">No. 10 seed David Nalbandian recovered from back spasms that forced him out of the Kooyong exhibition last week to beat Australian Robert Smeets 6-1, 6-1, 7-6 (3).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Other men advancing included No. 21 Juan Monaco of Argentina and No. 25 Fernando Verdasco of Spain, and Amer Delic beat fellow American Robert Kendrick 6-4, 7-5, 6-2.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Women's No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze only played six points before advancing to the second round when Germany's Andrea Petkovic retired with a leg injury.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">No. 9 Daniela Hantuchova advanced 6-3, 7-5 over Vania King of the United States; No. 27 Maria Kirilenko beat American Meilen Tu 6-4, 4-6, 6-3; Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark upset Gisela Dulko of Argentina 6-1, 6-1 and Japan's Akiko Morigami beat Michaella Krajicek 6-2, 6-2.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Top-ranked Federer, aiming for a third consecutive Australian title and claiming to be 100 percent recovered from a stomach virus that interrupted his preparation, had a night match scheduled against Diego Hartfield of Argentina.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Venus Williams was to play China's Yan Zi on Rod Laver Arena in the first night match.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Her sister Serena, the defending champion, started off the season's first major with a 6-3, 6-3 win Monday over wild-card entry Jarmila Gajdosova.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was her first match back at Rod Laver Arena since a 6-1, 6-2 rout of Maria Sharapova in last year's final, when she became only the second unseeded player and third-lowest ranked (81) player to win a Grand Slam title.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"It definitely feels good to be back," Williams said. "I just thought about last year, my last match on that court, I was able to win it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"That's all I thought about. I didn't think about the ceremony, holding up the trophy. I just got right back into the swing of things and thought, I have to stay focused."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Sharapova had an opening-round 6-4, 6-3 win over Jelena Kostanic Tosic, insisting that her previous match at Melbourne Park was long forgotten.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">"You can't think about what you did in the past years," she said. "You can't think about what your results were. You just got to look forward to what's going to come up."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">What's coming up for her is a second-round match against 2000 champion Lindsay Davenport, quickly becoming something of a Supermom after holding off Italy's Sara Errani 6-2, 3-6, 7-5.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">She lost her temper at the chair umpire on an overrule and worked through bouts of pressure, but had enough experience to extend her record to 19-1 since returning to the tour following the birth of her son, Jagger, last June.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It also made her the richest prize money earner ever in women's tennis, lifting her career tally to $21,897,501 and surpassing Steffi Graf's total.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Top-seeded Justine Henin also was in action Monday, extending her winning streak to 29 matches when she won the last six games of a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Japan's Aiko Nakamura.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">On the men's side, No. 2 Rafael Nadal had to recover from service breaks in each of the first two sets to beat Viktor Troicki of Serbia 7-6 (3), 7-5, 6-1 late Monday.</span>
