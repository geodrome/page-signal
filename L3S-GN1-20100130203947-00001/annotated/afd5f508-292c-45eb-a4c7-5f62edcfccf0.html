<span class="x-nc-sel1">More authority needed</span>
</h1>
<p class="articlepage-articlepublishedline">
<span class="x-nc-sel3">Published on        14/01/2008</span>
</p>
<p class="articlepage-articletext">
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Doncaster Rovers 1 Carlisle United 0</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">AFTER the sort of winning goal that requires a magnifying glass to identify the scorer, Dennis Wise tucked away his notebook and slipped away from the Keepmoat Stadium.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The Leeds United manager had been running his eye over Doncaster in anticipation of next week?s fixture, and his combat notes presumably read something like: ?Doncaster: they?ll pass both you and themselves to death, over-elaborate a bit in the final third, but don?t think they aren?t capable of an ugly goal if that?s what it takes?.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Under ?Carlisle?, Wise doubtless filled his page with a couple of question marks and the overriding poser: ?Was I really chased out of Brunton Park in November on the end of a 3-1 clobbering? Worked their socks off but must have used up all their spark and ruthlessness on us. Just my luck.?</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">While Wise wrestles with life?s mysteries, let us get on with telling Saturday?s tale of one team who found an unsightly way of winning a game they had graced with elaborate patterns, and of another side who were handed the ultimate punishment for failing to strike when the game coughed up a couple of golden chances.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">That?s the main plot line, although another running theme was Doncaster?s superiority for a good two-thirds of this match.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The home side?s winning goal was late, left a small tang of controversy, and would be laughed out of town if it showed up at a beauty contest. But this was no escape to victory from Sean O?Driscoll?s men.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">?There were two good sides out there today,? asserted John Ward as the lights dimmed in Doncaster?s fine new arena.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">The league table says he?s right, as does plenty of archive evidence and some of what the Blues did in the second half here. But ask us to reconcile Saturday?s general performance with what you come to expect from a side who start the day in a position of great strength ? second in League One ? and the pen has to be dragged across the page.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was certainly a day of undoubted hard work and honest discipline from Ward?s men, and their strategy of sponging Doncaster?s pressure almost delivered a welcome point until the hosts scored their gargoyle of a goal in the 84th minute.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">There must also be a willingness to recognise that high-stakes games like these are not always visual delights, and that teams like Doncaster, at home, will always oblige you to spend more time in the trenches than out in the open, going for the kill.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">From this angle, though, there wasn?t enough balance from Carlisle, nowhere near enough persuasive, confident attacking to reward all that defensive slog.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">And when United?s sporadic assaults on Rovers? goal eventually did yield a brace of opportunities, Simon Hackney and Marc Bridge-Wilkinson were unable to supply the clinical touches which might have sent the match down a different route.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Doncaster, dominant in the first half without being particularly cutting themselves, then flew back off the ropes and finally took their 84th-minute winner.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It was rooted in Zigor Aranalde?s trip on Jason Price as the ball was trickling out of play.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">There then followed an interminable delay as Rovers sub Mark Wilson prepared to take the field in place of the injured Stock; a painstaking procedure which involved the midfielder removing his tracksuit bottoms and top, finding his shirt, reading a couple of epic novels, ordering a pizza and then eventually making his way onto the turf.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Ward, while not offering this needless stoppage as an excuse, felt it may have taken some of the urgency out of his players? minds as they tried desperately to hack clear Gareth Roberts? free-kick, but failed to stop James Hayter smuggling the ball over the line.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Pressure</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">And there?s a reasonable argument which says United?s defenders were the last people who deserved to be breached by a goal of such misfortune. But such was Carlisle?s lot: conquered by the sheer weight of pressure.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">As it happened, they almost found their way to a draw, when Joe Garner sent a rare, injury-time firecracker towards the bottom corner. But Neil Sullivan, 37, sprang youthfully to his left, tipped the shot away, and Doncaster had their victory.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">A victory which they seemed to assume was their birthright, judging by their often-impressive but sometimes indulgent first-half play. Their passing and movement, directed by the urgent Richie Wellens in midfield, was frequently conducted at dizzying speed, but too many of their shots from the margins of the penalty area failed to test Keiren Westwood, while Peter Murphy and the redoubtable Danny Livesey mopped up the rest.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">In chronological order: Wellens, Paul Green, Brian Stock, and Wellens again, three more times: all took unsuccessful pot-shots from reasonable territory. The final missile launched by Wellens actually found the target, but ref Lee Mason had already blown for a foul by a Rovers player.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">United, for whom Jeff Smith became the latest player to be handed right-wing duties, (albeit in a narrower midfield which received several adjustments as the game went on), defended willingly, but a solitary first-half chance ? an innocuous header over by Garner ? did little to stir the blood of their 1,242 followers, who had witnessed their team?s midfield too often outmanoeuvred and profligate with possession.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Promisingly, there followed a spasm of early second-half pressure which finally suggested Carlisle could pose a lasting threat of their own. In the 49th minute, a booming Westwood kick was glanced on by Garner and headed on again by Danny Graham. It fell perfectly for Hackney, in space and in front of goal ? but on this occasion the seven-goal winger?s rapier finish was absent.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Westwood then did well to deny the raiding Price and James Coppinger, before United ? now competing brightly and evenly with their hosts ? fashioned their next chance. David Raven made decent progress down the right, Garner threw over an inviting cross, but Bridge-Wilkinson couldn?t keep his header down.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Reprieved, Doncaster came again. Coppinger and Price sent a couple more shots down Westwood?s throat, the former had one of several optimistic home penalty appeals dismissed ? and then, finally, came the goal, which Rovers almost added to in the 90th minute, when Cumbrian sub Lewis Guy went on a bustling run which went unrewarded by Hayter?s wayward finish.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Then there was Garner?s late howitzer, Sullivan?s save, and an appearance by Westwood in the opposition box for two subsequent corners which came, like United?s afternoon, to nought.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">So where do we point the torch first ? to this spluttering away form, which now shows three defeats on the spin and no goals scored? To United?s patent need for the balance a right-winger will provide, hence the pursuit of Scunthorpe?s Cleveland Taylor?</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">To their irritating susceptibility to being caught on the counter-attack from their own corners, a glitch on which Doncaster might easily have capitalised on Saturday?</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Take your pick, while also being scrupulously fair and saying that Doncaster have many of the qualities that a promotion contender needs, except perhaps an assassin?s readiness to insert the knife.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">Throw all this onto the page, though, and you still have to conclude that there needs to be more authority from Carlisle on days like this. ?Don?t underestimate yourselves,? was one of the messages sent out by Ward last week.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">It needs repeating again today, and at full volume.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">MANAGER?S VIEW:</span>
</b>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">?United boss John Ward, above: ?After defending well throughout the game it was disappointing to lose to that sort of ball coming in. It was a bobbly sort of goal and no-one really knows how it?s gone in.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">?I felt for the boys bec ause they put a massive effort in today and no little quality in terms of our attacking play in the second half.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="x-nc-sel2">?My answer to the questions about our away form is that if we keep playing like this it will turn quickly. The people who were here won?t ask that question, that will come from the people who weren?t here.?</span>
